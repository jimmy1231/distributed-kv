UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive
operating system for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers. It offers a number
of features seldom found even in larger operating systems, including: (1) a hierarchical file system incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible file, device,
and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command language selectable on a per-user basis; and (5) over 100 subsystems
including a dozen languages. This paper discusses the
nature and implementation of the file system and of the
user command interface.

1. Introduction
There have been three versions of UNIX. The earliest
version (circa 1969–70) ran on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 and -9 computers. The second version ran
on the unprotected PDP-11/20 computer. This paper
describes only the PDP-11/40 and /45 [l] system since it is
more modern and many of the differences between it and
older UNIX systems result from redesign of features found
to be deficient or lacking.
Since PDP-11 UNIX became operational in February
1971, about 40 installations have been put into service; they
are generally smaller than the system described here. Most
of them are engaged in applications such as the preparation
and formatting of patent applications and other textual
material, the collection and processing of trouble data from
various switching machines within the Bell System, and
recording and checking telephone service orders. Our own
installation is used mainly for research in operating systems, languages, computer networks, and other topics in
computer science, and also for document preparation.
Perhaps the most important achievement of UNIX is to
demonstrate that a powerful operating system for interactive use need not be expensive either in equipment or in
human effort: UNIX can run on hardware costing as little as
$40,000, and less than two man years were spent on the
main system software. Yet UNIX contains a number of features seldom offered even in much larger systems. It is
hoped, however, the users of UNIX will find that the most
important characteristics of the system are its simplicity,
elegance, and ease of use.
Besides the system proper, the major programs available under UNIX are: assembler, text editor based on QED
[2], linking loader, symbolic debugger, compiler for a language resembling BCPL [3] with types and structures (C),
interpreter for a dialect of BASIC, text formatting program,
Fortran compiler, Snobol interpreter, top-down compilercompiler (TMG) [4], bottom-up compiler-compiler (YACC),
form letter generator, macro processor (M6) [5], and permuted index program.
There is also a host of maintenance, utility, recreation,
and novelty programs. All of these programs were written
locally. It is worth noting that the system is totally self-supporting. All UNIX software is maintained under UNIX; likewise, UNIX documents are generated and formatted by the
UNIX editor and text formatting program.
2. Hardware and Software Environment
The PDP-11/45 on which our UNIX installation is implemented is a 16-bit word (8-bit byte) computer with 144K
bytes of core memory; UNIX occupies 42K bytes. This system, however, includes a very large number of device drivers and enjoys a generous allotment of space for I/O buffers
and system tables; a minimal system capable of running the
366 Electronic version recreated by Eric A. Brewer
University of California at Berkeley
Communications July 1974
of Volume 17
the ACM Number 7
software mentioned above can require as little as 50K bytes
of core altogether.
The PDP-11 has a 1M byte fixed-head disk, used for file
system storage and swapping, four moving-head disk drives
which each provide 2.5M bytes on removable disk cartridges, and a single moving-head disk drive which uses
removable 40M byte disk packs. There are also a highspeed paper tape reader-punch, nine-track magnetic tape,
and D-tape (a variety of magnetic tape facility in which
individual records may be addressed and rewritten).
Besides the console typewriter, there are 14 variable-speed
communications interfaces attached to 100-series datasets
and a 201 dataset interface used primarily for spooling
printout to a communal line printer. There are also several
one-of-a-kind devices including a Picturephone® interface,
a voice response unit, a voice synthesizer, a phototypesetter,
a digital switching network, and a satellite PDP-11/20 which
generates vectors, curves, and characters on a Tektronix 611
storage-tube display.
The greater part of UNIX software is written in the
above-mentioned C language [6]. Early versions of the
operating system were written in assembly language, but
during the summer of 1973, it was rewritten in C. The size
of the new system is about one third greater than the old.
Since the new system is not only much easier to understand
and to modify but also includes many functional improvements, including multiprogramming and the ability to share
reentrant code among several user programs, we considered
this increase in size quite acceptable.
3. The File System
The most important job of UNIX is to provide a file system. From the point of view of the user, there are three
kinds of files: ordinary disk files, directories, and special
files.
3.1 Ordinary Files
A file contains whatever information the user places on
it, for example symbolic or binary (object) programs. No
particular structuring is expected by the system. Files of
text consist simply of a string of characters, with lines
demarcated by the new-line character. Binary programs are
sequences of words as they will appear in core memory
when the program starts executing. A few user programs
manipulate files with more structure: the assembler generates and the loader expects an object file in a particular format. However, the structure of files is controlled by the
programs which use them, not by the system.
3.2 Directories
Directories provide the mapping between the names of
files and the files themselves, and thus induce a structure on
the file system as a whole. Each user has a directory of his
own files; he may also create subdirectories to contain
groups of files conveniently treated together. A directory
behaves exactly like an ordinary file except that it cannot be
written on by unprivileged programs, so that the system
controls the contents of directories. However, anyone with
appropriate permission may read a directory just like any
other file.
The system maintains several directories for its own
use. One of these is the root directory. All files in the system can be found by tracing a path through a chain of directories until the desired file is reached. The starting point for
such searches is often the root. Another system directory
contains all the programs provided for general use; that is,
all the commands. As will be seen however, it is by no
means necessary that a program reside in this directory for
it to be executed.
Files are named by sequences of 14 or fewer characters. When the name of a file is specified to the system, it
may be in the form of a path name, which is a sequence of
directory names separated by slashes “/” and ending in a
file name. If the sequence begins with a slash, the search
begins in the root directory. The name /alpha/beta/gamma
causes the system to search the root for directory alpha,
then to search alpha for beta, finally to find gamma in beta.
Gamma may be an ordinary file, a directory, or a special
file. As a limiting case, the name “/” refers to the root itself.
A path name not starting with “/” causes the system to
begin the search in the user’s current directory. Thus, the
name alpha/beta specifies the file named beta in subdirectory alpha of the current directory. The simplest kind of
name, for example alpha, refers to a file which itself is
found in the current directory. As another limiting case, the
null file name refers to the current directory.
The same nondirectory file may appear in several
directories under possibly different names. This feature is
called linking; a directory entry for a file is sometimes
called a link. UNIX differs from other systems in which linking is permitted in that all links to a file have equal status.
That is, a file does not exist within a particular directory;
the directory entry for a file consists merely of its name and
a pointer to the information actually describing the file.
Thus a file exists independently of any directory entry,
although in practice a file is made to disappear along with
the last link to it.
Each directory always has at least two entries. The
name in each directory refers to the directory itself. Thus a
program may read the current directory under the name “.”
without knowing its complete path name. The name “..” by
convention refers to the parent of the directory in which it
appears, that is, to the directory in which it was created.
The directory structure is constrained to have the form
of a rooted tree. Except for the special entries “.” and “..”,
each directory must appear as an entry in exactly one other,
which is its parent. The reason for this is to simplify the
writing of programs which visit subtrees of the directory
367 Electronic version recreated by Eric A. Brewer

the ACM Number 7
structure, and more important, to avoid the separation of
portions of the hierarchy. If arbitrary links to directories
were permitted, it would be quite difficult to detect when
the last connection from the root to a directory was severed.
3.3 Special Files
Special files constitute the most unusual feature of the
UNIX file system. Each I/O device supported by UNIX is
associated with at least one such file. Special files are read
and written just like ordinary disk files, but requests to read
or write result in activation of the associated device. An
entry for each special file resides in directory /dev, although
a link may be made to one of these files just like an ordinary file. Thus, for example, to punch paper tape, one may
write on the file /dev/ppt. Special files exist for each communication line, each disk, each tape drive, and for physical
core memory. Of course, the active disks and the core special file are protected from indiscriminate access.
There is a threefold advantage in treating I/O devices
this way: file and device I/O are as similar as possible; file
and device names have the same syntax and meaning, so
that a program expecting a file name as a parameter can be
passed a device name; finally, special files are subject to the
same protection mechanism as regular files.
3.4 Removable File Systems
Although the root of the file system is always stored on
the same device, it is not necessary that the entire file system hierarchy reside on this device. There is a mount system request which has two arguments: the name of an
existing ordinary file, and the name of a direct-access special file whose associated storage volume (e.g. disk pack)
should have the structure of an independent file system containing its own directory hierarchy. The effect of mount is to
cause references to the heretofore ordinary file to refer
instead to the root directory of the file system on the removable volume. In effect, mount replaces a leaf of the hierarchy tree (the ordinary file) by a whole new subtree (the
hierarchy stored on the removable volume). After the
mount, there is virtually no distinction between files on the
removable volume and those in the permanent file system.
In our installation, for example, the root directory resides
on the fixed-head disk, and the large disk drive, which contains user’s files, is mounted by the system initialization
program, the four smaller disk drives are available to users
for mounting their own disk packs. A mountable file system
is generated by writing on its corresponding special file. A
utility program is available to create an empty file system,
or one may simply copy an existing file system.
There is only one exception to the rule of identical
treatment of files on different devices: no link may exist
between one file system hierarchy and another. This restriction is enforced so as to avoid the elaborate bookkeeping
which would otherwise be required to assure removal of the
links when the removable volume is finally dismounted. In
particular, in the root directories of all file systems, removable or not, the name “..” refers to the directory itself
instead of to its parent.
3.5 Protection
Although the access control scheme in UNIX is quite
simple, it has some unusual features. Each user of the system is assigned a unique user identification number. When
a file is created, it is marked with the user ID of its owner.
Also given for new files is a set of seven protection bits. Six
of these specify independently read, write, and execute permission for the owner of the file and for all other users.
If the seventh bit is on, the system will temporarily
change the user identification of the current user to that of
the creator of the file whenever the file is executed as a program. This change in user ID is effective only during the
execution of the program which calls for it. The set-user-ID
feature provides for privileged programs which may use
files inaccessible to other users. For example, a program
may keep an accounting file which should neither be read
nor changed except by the program itself. If the set-useridentification bit is on for the program, it may access the
file although this access might be forbidden to other programs invoked by the given program’s user. Since the
actual user ID of the invoker of any program is always
available, set-user-ID programs may take any measures
desired to satisfy themselves as to their invoker’s credentials. This mechanism is used to allow users to execute the
carefully written commands which call privileged system
entries. For example, there is a system entry invocable only
by the “super-user” (below) which creates an empty directory. As indicated above, directories are expected to have
entries for “.” and “..”. The command which creates a directory is owned by the super user and has the set-user-ID bit
set. After it checks its invoker’s authorization to create the
specified directory, it creates it and makes the entries for “.”
and “..”.
Since anyone may set the set-user-ID bit on one of his
own files, this mechanism is generally available with- out
administrative intervention. For example, this protection
scheme easily solves the MOO accounting problem posed in
[7].
The system recognizes one particular user ID (that of
the “super-user”) as exempt from the usual constraints on
file access; thus (for example) programs may be written to
dump and reload the file system without unwanted interference from the protection system.
3.6 I/O Calls
The system calls to do I/O are designed to eliminate the
differences between the various devices and styles of
access. There is no distinction between “random” and
sequential I/O, nor is any logical record size imposed by the
system. The size of an ordinary file is determined by the
368 Electronic version recreated by Eric A. Brewer
University of California at Berkeley
Communications July 1974
of Volume 17
the ACM Number 7
highest byte written on it; no predetermination of the size of
a file is necessary or possible.
To illustrate the essentials of I/O in UNIX, Some of the
basic calls are summarized below in an anonymous language which will indicate the required parameters without
getting into the complexities of machine language programming. Each call to the system may potentially result in an
error return, which for simplicity is not represented in the
calling sequence.
To read or write a file assumed to exist already, it must
be opened by the following call:
filep = open (name, flag)
Name indicates the name of the file. An arbitrary path name
may be given. The flag argument indicates whether the file
is to be read, written, or “updated”, that is read and written
simultaneously.
The returned value filep is called a file descriptor. It is
a small integer used to identify the file in subsequent calls
to read, write, or otherwise manipulate it.
To create a new file or completely rewrite an old one,
there is a create system call which creates the given file if it
does not exist, or truncates it to zero length if it does exist.
Create also opens the new file for writing and, like open,
returns a file descriptor.
There are no user-visible locks in the file system, nor is
there any restriction on the number of users who may have
a file open for reading or writing; although it is possible for
the contents of a file to become scrambled when two users
write on it simultaneously, in practice, difficulties do not
arise. We take the view that locks are neither necessary nor
sufficient, in our environment, to prevent interference
between users of the same file. They are unnecessary
because we are not faced with large, single-file data bases
maintained by independent processes. They are insufficient
because locks in the ordinary sense, whereby one user is
prevented from writing on a file which another user is reading, cannot prevent confusion when, for example, both
users are editing a file with an editor which makes a copy of
the file being edited.
It should be said that the system has sufficient internal
interlocks to maintain the logical consistency of the file system when two users engage simultaneously in such inconvenient activities as writing on the same file, creating files
in the same directory or deleting each other’s open files.
Except as indicated below, reading and writing are
sequential. This means that if a particular byte in the file
was the last byte written (or read), the next I/O call implicitly refers to the first following byte. For each open file
there is a pointer, maintained by the system, which indicates the next byte to be read or written. If n bytes are read
or written, the pointer advances by n bytes.
Once a file is open, the following calls may be used:
n = read(filep, buffer, count)
n = write(filep, buffer, count)
Up to count bytes are transmitted between the file specified
by filep and the byte array specified by buffer. The returned
value n is the number of bytes actually transmitted. In the
write case, n is the same as count except under exceptional
conditions like I/O errors or end of physical medium on special files; in a read, however, n may without error be less
than count. If the read pointer is so near the end of the file
that reading count characters would cause reading beyond
the end, only sufficient bytes are transmitted to reach the
end of the file; also, typewriter-like devices never return
more than one line of input. When a read call returns with n
equal to zero, it indicates the end of the file. For disk files
this occurs when the read pointer becomes equal to the current size of the file. It is possible to generate an end-of-file
from a typewriter by use of an escape sequence which
depends on the device used.
Bytes written on a file affect only those implied by the
position of the write pointer and the count; no other part of
the file is changed. If the last byte lies beyond the end of the
file, the file is grown as needed.
To do random (direct access) I/O, it is only necessary to
move the read or write pointer to the appropriate location in
the file.
location = seek(filep, base, offset)
The pointer associated with filep is moved to a position offset bytes from the beginning of the file, from the current
position of the pointer, or from the end of the file, depending on base. Offset may be negative. For some devices (e.g.
paper tape and typewriters) seek calls are ignored. The
actual offset from the beginning of the file to which the
pointer was moved is returned in location.
3.6.1 Other I/O Calls. There are several additional system entries having to do with I/O and with the file system
which will not be discussed. For example: close a file, get
the status of a file, change the protection mode or the owner
of a file, create a directory, make a link to an existing file,
delete a file.
4. Implementation of the File System
As mentioned in §3.2 above, a directory entry contains
only a name for the associated file and a pointer to the file
itself. This pointer is an integer called the i-number (for
index number) of the file. When the file is accessed, its inumber is used as an index into a system table (the i-list)
stored in a known part of the device on which the directory
resides. The entry thereby found (the file’s i-node) contains
the description of the file as follows.
1. Its owner.
2. Its protection bits.
3. The physical disk or tape addresses for the file
contents.
4. Its size.
369 Electronic version recreated by Eric A. Brewer

the ACM Number 7
5. Time of last modification
6. The number of links to the file, that is, the number of
times it appears in a directory.
7. A bit indicating whether the file is a directory.
8. A bit indicating whether the file is a special file.
9. A bit indicating whether the file is “large” or “small.”
The purpose of an open or create system call is to turn the
path name given by the user into an i-number by searching
the explicitly or implicitly named directories. Once a file is
open, its device, i-number, and read/write pointer are stored
in a system table indexed by the file descriptor returned by
the open or create. Thus the file descriptor supplied during
a subsequent call to read or write the file may be easily
related to the information necessary to access the file.
When a new file is created, an i-node is allocated for it
and a directory entry is made which contains the name of
the file and the i-node number. Making a link to an existing
file involves creating a directory entry with the new name,
copying the i-number from the original file entry, and incrementing the link-count field of the i-node. Removing
(deleting) a file is done by decrementing the link-count of
the i-node specified by its directory entry and erasing the
directory entry. If the link-count drops to 0, any disk blocks
in the file are freed and the i-node is deallocated.
The space on all fixed or removable disks which contain a file system is divided into a number of 512-byte
blocks logically addressed from 0 up to a limit which
depends on the device. There is space in the i-node of each
file for eight device addresses. A small (nonspecial) file fits
into eight or fewer blocks; in this case the addresses of the
blocks themselves are stored. For large (nonspecial) files,
each of the eight device addresses may point to an indirect
block of 256 addresses of blocks constituting the file itself.
These files may be as large as 8⋅256⋅512, or l,048,576 (220)
bytes.
The foregoing discussion applies to ordinary files.
When an I/O request is made to a file whose i-node indicates that it is special, the last seven device address words
are immaterial, and the list is interpreted as a pair of bytes
which constitute an internal device name. These bytes specify respectively a device type and subdevice number. The
device type indicates which system routine will deal with I/
O on that device; the subdevice number selects, for example, a disk drive attached to a particular controller or one of
several similar typewriter interfaces.
In this environment, the implementation of the mount
system call (§3.4) is quite straightforward. Mount maintains
a system table whose argument is the i-number and device
name of the ordinary file specified during the mount, and
whose corresponding value is the device name of the indicated special file. This table is searched for each (i-number,
device)-pair which turns up while a path name is being
scanned during an open or create; if a match is found, the inumber is replaced by 1 (which is the i-number of the root
directory on all file systems), and the device name is
replaced by the table value.
To the user, both reading and writing of files appear to
be synchronous and unbuffered. That is immediately after
return from a read call the data are available, and conversely after a write the user’s workspace may be reused. In
fact the system maintains a rather complicated buffering
mechanism which reduces greatly the number of I/O operations required to access a file. Suppose a write call is made
specifying transmission of a single byte.
UNIX will search its buffers to see whether the affected
disk block currently resides in core memory; if not, it will
be read in from the device. Then the affected byte is
replaced in the buffer, and an entry is made in a list of
blocks to be written. The return from the write call may
then take place, although the actual I/O may not be completed until a later time. Conversely, if a single byte is read,
the system determines whether the secondary storage block
in which the byte is located is already in one of the system’s
buffers; if so, the byte can be returned immediately. If not,
the block is read into a buffer and the byte picked out.
A program which reads or writes files in units of 512
bytes has an advantage over a program which reads or
writes a single byte at a time, but the gain is not immense; it
comes mainly from the avoidance of system overhead. A
program which is used rarely or which does no great volume of I/O may quite reasonably read and write in units as
small as it wishes.
The notion of the i-list is an unusual feature of UNIX. In
practice, this method of organizing the file system has
proved quite reliable and easy to deal with. To the system
itself, one of its strengths is the fact that each file has a
short, unambiguous name which is related in a simple way
to the protection, addressing, and other information needed
to access the file. It also permits a quite simple and rapid
algorithm for checking the consistency of a file system, for
example verification that the portions of each device containing useful information and those free to be allocated are
disjoint and together exhaust the space on the device. This
algorithm is independent of the directory hierarchy, since it
need only scan the linearly-organized i-list. At the same
time the notion of the i-list induces certain peculiarities not
found in other file system organizations. For example, there
is the question of who is to be charged for the space a file
occupies, since all directory entries for a file have equal status. Charging the owner of a file is unfair, in general, since
one user may create a file, another may link to it, and the
first user may delete the file. The first user is still the owner
of the file, but it should be charged to the second user. The
simplest reasonably fair algorithm seems to be to spread the
charges equally among users who have links to a file. The
current version of UNIX avoids the issue by not charging
any fees at all.

4.1 Efficiency of the File System
To provide an indication of the overall efficiency of
UNIX and of the file system in particular, timings were made
of the assembly of a 7621-line program. The assembly was
run alone on the machine; the total clock time was 35.9 sec,
for a rate of 212 lines per sec. The time was divided as follows: 63.5 percent assembler execution time, 16.5 percent
system overhead, 20.0 percent disk wait time. We will not
attempt any interpretation of these figures nor any comparison with other systems, but merely note that we are generally satisfied with the overall performance of the system.
5. Processes and Images
An image is a computer execution environment. It
includes a core image, general register values, status of
open files, current directory, and the like. An image is the
current state of a pseudo computer.
A process is the execution of an image. While the processor is executing on behalf of a process, the image must
reside in core; during the execution of other processes it
remains in core unless the appearance of an active, higherpriority process forces it to be swapped out to the fixedhead disk.
The user-core part of an image is divided into three
logical segments. The program text segment begins at location 0 in the virtual address space. During execution, this
segment is write-protected and a single copy of it is shared
among all processes executing the same program. At the
first 8K byte boundary above the program text segment in
the virtual address space begins a non-shared, writable data
segment, the size of which may be extended by a system
call. Starting at the highest address in the virtual address
space is a stack segment, which automatically grows downward as the hardware’s stack pointer fluctuates.
5.1 Processes
Except while UNIX is bootstrapping itself into operation, a new process can come into existence only by use of
the fork system call:
processid = fork (label)
When fork is executed by a process, it splits into two independently executing processes. The two processes have
independent copies of the original core image, and share
any open files. The new processes differ only in that one is
considered the parent process: in the parent, control returns
directly from the fork, while in the child, control is passed
to location label. The processid returned by the fork call is
the identification of the other process.
Because the return points in the parent and child process are not the same, each image existing after a fork may
determine whether it is the parent or child process.
5.2 Pipes
Processes may communicate with related processes
using the same system read and write calls that are used for
file system I/O. The call
filep = pipe( )
returns a file descriptor filep and creates an interprocess
channel called a pipe. This channel, like other open flies, is
passed from parent to child process in the image by the fork
call. A read using a pipe file descriptor waits until another
process writes using the file descriptor for the same pipe. At
this point, data are passed between the images of the two
processes. Neither process need know that a pipe, rather
than an ordinary file, is involved.
Although interprocess communication via pipes is a
quite valuable tool (see §6.2), it is not a completely general
mechanism since the pipe must be set up by a common
ancestor of the processes involved.
5.3 Execution of Programs
Another major system primitive is invoked by
execute(file, arg1, arg2, ..., argn)
which requests the system to read in and execute the program named by file, passing it string arguments arg1, arg2,
..., argn. Ordinarily, arg1 should be the same string as file,
so that the program may determine the name by which it
was invoked. All the code and data in the process using execute is replaced from the file, but open files, current directory, and interprocess relationships are unaltered. Only if
the call fails, for example because file could not be found or
because its execute-permission bit was not set, does a return
take place from the execute primitive; it resembles a “jump”
machine instruction rather than a subroutine call.
5.4 Process Synchronization
Another process control system call
processid = wait( )
causes its caller to suspend execution until one of its children has completed execution. Then wait returns the processid of the terminated process. An error return is taken if
the calling process has no descendants. Certain status from
the child process is also available. Wait may also present
status from a grandchild or more distant ancestor; see §5.5.
5.5 Termination
Lastly,
exit (status)
terminates a process, destroys its image, closes its open
files, and generally obliterates it. When the parent is notified through the wait primitive, the indicated status is available to the parent; if the parent has already terminated, the
status is available to the grandparent, and so on. Processes

may also terminate as a result of various illegal actions or
user-generated signals (§7 below).
6. The Shell
For most users, communication with UNIX is carried on
with the aid of a program called the Shell. The Shell is a
command line interpreter: it reads lines typed by the user
and interprets them as requests to execute other programs.
In simplest form, a command line consists of the command
name followed by arguments to the command, all separated
by spaces:
command arg1 arg2 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ argn
The Shell splits up the command name and the arguments
into separate strings. Then a file with name command is
sought; command may be a path name including the “/”
character to specify any file in the system. If command is
found, it is brought into core and executed. The arguments
collected by the Shell are accessible to the command. When
the command is finished, the Shell resumes its own execution, and indicates its readiness to accept another command
by typing a prompt character.
If file command cannot be found, the Shell prefixes the
string /bin/ to command and attempts again to find the file.
Directory /bin contains all the commands intended to be
generally used.
6.1 Standard I/O
The discussion of I/O in §3 above seems to imply that
every file used by a program must be opened or created by
the program in order to get a file descriptor for the file. Programs executed by the Shell, however, start off with two
open files which have file descriptors 0 and 1. As such a
program begins execution, file 1 is open for writing, and is
best understood as the standard output file. Except under
circumstances indicated below, this file is the user’s typewriter. Thus programs which wish to write informative or
diagnostic information ordinarily use file descriptor 1. Conversely, file 0 starts off open for reading, and programs
which wish to read messages typed by the user usually read
this file.
The Shell is able to change the standard assignments of
these file descriptors from the user’s typewriter printer and
keyboard. If one of the arguments ‘to a command is prefixed by “〉”, file descriptor 1 will, for the duration of the
command, refer to the file named after the “〉”. For example,
ls
ordinarily lists, on the typewriter, the names of the files in
the current directory. The command
ls 〉there
creates a file called there and places the listing there. Thus
the argument “〉there” means, “place output on there.” On
the other hand,
ed
ordinarily enters the editor, which takes requests from the
user via his typewriter. The command
ed 〈script
interprets script as a file of editor commands; thus “〈script”
means, “take input from script.”
Although the file name following “〈” or “〉” appears to
be an argument to the command, in fact it is interpreted
completely by the Shell and is not passed to the command
at all. Thus no special coding to handle I/O redirection is
needed within each command; the command need merely
use the standard file descriptors 0 and 1 where appropriate.
6.2 Filters
An extension of the standard I/O notion is used to direct
output from one command to the input of another. A
sequence of commands separated by vertical bars causes
the Shell to execute all the commands simultaneously and
to arrange that the standard output of each command be
delivered to the standard input of the next command in the
sequence. Thus in the command line
ls | pr –2 | opr
ls lists the names of the files in the current directory; its output is passed to pr, which paginates its input with dated
headings. The argument “–2” means double column. Likewise the output from pr is input to opr. This command
spools its input onto a file for off-line printing.
This process could have been carried out more clumsily by
ls 〉temp1
pr –2 〈temp1 〉temp2
opr 〈temp2
followed by removal of the temporary files. In the absence
of the ability to redirect output and input, a still clumsier
method would have been to require the ls command to
accept user requests to paginate its output, to print in multicolumn format, and to arrange that its output be delivered
off-line. Actually it would be surprising, and in fact unwise
for efficiency reasons, to expect authors of commands such
as ls to provide such a wide variety of output options.
A program such as pr which copies its standard input
to its standard output (with processing) is called a filter.
Some filters which we have found useful perform character
transliteration, sorting of the input, and encryption and
decryption.

6.3 Command Separators: Multitasking
Another feature provided by the Shell is relatively
straightforward. Commands need not be on different lines;
instead they may be separated by semicolons.
ls; ed
will first list the contents of the current directory, then enter
the editor.
A related feature is more interesting. If a command is
followed by “&”, the Shell will not wait for the command
to finish before prompting again; instead, it is ready immediately to accept a new command. For example,
as source 〉output &
causes source to be assembled, with diagnostic output
going to output; no matter how long the assembly takes, the
Shell returns immediately. When the Shell does not wait for
the completion of a command, the identification of the process running that command is printed. This identification
may be used to wait for the completion of the command or
to terminate it. The “&” may be used several times in a line:
as source 〉output & ls 〉files &
does both the assembly and the listing in the background. In
the examples above using “&”, an output file other than the
typewriter was provided; if this had not been done, the outputs of the various commands would have been intermingled.
The Shell also allows parentheses in the above operations. For example,
(date; ls) 〉x &
prints the current date and time followed by a list of the current directory onto the file x. The Shell also returns immediately for another request.
6.4 The Shell as a Command: Command files
The Shell is itself a command, and may be called recursively. Suppose file tryout contains the lines
as source
mv a.out testprog
testprog
The mv command causes the file a.out to be renamed
testprog. a.out is the (binary) output of the assembler, ready
to be executed. Thus if the three lines above were typed on
the console, source would be assembled, the resulting program named testprog, and testprog executed. When the
lines are in tryout, the command
sh 〈tryout
would cause the Shell sh to execute the commands sequentially.
The Shell has further capabilities, including the ability
to substitute parameters and to construct argument lists
from a specified subset of the file names in a directory. It is
also possible to execute commands conditionally on character string comparisons or on existence of given files and to
perform transfers of control within filed command
sequences.
6.5 Implementation of the Shell
The outline of the operation of the Shell can now be
understood. Most of tile time, the Shell is waiting for the
user to type a command. When the new-line character ending the line is typed, the Shell’s read call returns. The Shell
analyzes the command line, putting the arguments in a form
appropriate for execute. Then fork is called. The child process, whose code of course is still that of the Shell, attempts
to perform an execute with the appropriate arguments. If
successful, this will bring in and start execution of the program whose name was given. Meanwhile, the other process
resulting from the fork, which is the parent process, waits
for the child process to die. When this happens, the Shell
knows the command is finished, so it types its prompt and
reads the typewriter to obtain another command.
Given this framework, the implementation of background processes is trivial; whenever a command line contains “&”, the Shell merely refrains from waiting for the
process which it created to execute the command.
Happily, all of this mechanism meshes very nicely with
the notion of standard input and output files. When a process is created by the fork primitive, it inherits not only the
core image of its parent but also all the files currently open
in its parent, including those with file descriptors 0 and 1.
The Shell, of course, uses these files to read command lines
and to write its prompts and diagnostics, and in the ordinary
case its children—the command programs—inherit them
automatically. When an argument with “〈” or “〉” is given
however, the offspring process, just before it performs execute, makes the standard I/O file descriptor 0 or 1 respectively refer to the named file. This is easy because, by
agreement, the smallest unused file descriptor is assigned
when a new file is opened (or created); it is only necessary
to close file 0 (or 1) and open the named file. Because the
process in which the command program runs simply terminates when it is through, the association between a file
specified after “〈” or “〉” and file descriptor 0 or 1 is ended
automatically when the process dies. Therefore the Shell
need not know the actual names of the files which are its
own standard input and output since it need never reopen
them.
Filters are straightforward extensions of standard I/O
redirection with pipes used instead of files.
In ordinary circumstances, the main loop of the Shell
never terminates. (The main loop includes that branch of
the return from fork belonging to the parent process; that is,
the branch which does a wait, then reads another command
line.) The one thing which causes the Shell to terminate is
discovering an end-of-file condition on its input file. Thus,
373 Electronic version recreated by Eric A. Brewer
University of California at Berkeley
Communications July 1974
of Volume 17
the ACM Number 7
when the Shell is executed as a command with a given input
file, as in
sh 〈comfile
the commands in comfile will be executed until the end of
comfile is reached; then the instance of the Shell invoked by
sh will terminate. Since this Shell process is the child of
another instance of the Shell, the wait executed in the latter
will return, and another command may be processed.
6.6 Initialization
The instances of the Shell to which users type commands are themselves children of another process. The last
step in the initialization of UNIX is the creation of a single
process and the invocation (via execute) of a program called
init. The role of init is to create one process for each typewriter channel which may be dialed up by a user. The various subinstances of init open the appropriate typewriters for
input and output. Since when init was invoked there were
no files open, in each process the typewriter keyboard will
receive file descriptor 0 and the printer file descriptor 1.
Each process types out a message requesting that the user
log in and waits, reading the typewriter, for a reply. At the
outset, no one is logged in, so each process simply hangs.
Finally someone types his name or other identification. The
appropriate instance of init wakes up, receives the log-in
line, and reads a password file. If the user name is found,
and if he is able to supply the correct password, init changes
to the user’s default current directory, sets the process’s user
ID to that of the person logging in, and performs an execute
of the Shell. At this point the Shell is ready to receive commands and the logging-in protocol is complete.
Meanwhile, the mainstream path of init (the parent of
all the subinstances of itself which will later become Shells)
does a wait. If one of the child processes terminates, either
because a Shell found an end of file or because a user typed
an incorrect name or password, this path of init simply recreates the defunct process, which in turn reopens the appropriate input and output files and types another login
message. Thus a user may log out simply by typing the endof-file sequence in place of a command to the Shell.
6.7 Other Programs as Shell
The Shell as described above is designed to allow users
full access to the facilities of the system since it will invoke
the execution of any program with appropriate protection
mode. Sometimes, however, a different interface to the system is desirable, and this feature is easily arranged.
Recall that after a user has successfully logged in by
supplying his name and password, init ordinarily invokes
the Shell to interpret command lines. The user’s entry in tile
password file may contain the name of a program to be
invoked after login instead of the Shell. This program is
free to interpret the user’s messages in any way it wishes.
For example, the password file entries for users of a
secretarial editing system specify that the editor ed is to be
used instead of the Shell. Thus when editing system users
log in, they are inside the editor and can begin work immediately; also, they can be prevented from invoking UNIX
programs not intended for their use. In practice, it has
proved desirable to allow a temporary escape from the editor to execute the formatting program and other utilities.
Several of the games (e.g. chess, blackjack, 3D tic-tactoe) available on UNIX illustrate a much more severely
restricted environment. For each of these an entry exists in
the password file specifying that the appropriate gameplaying program is to be invoked instead of the Shell. People who log in as a player of one of the games find themselves limited to the game and unable to investigate the
presumably more interesting offerings of UNIX as a whole.
7. Traps
The PDP-11 hardware detects a number of program
faults, such as references to nonexistent memory, unimplemented instructions, and odd addresses used where an even
address is required. Such faults cause the processor to trap
to a system routine. When an illegal action is caught, unless
other arrangements have been made, the system terminates
the process and writes the user’s image on file core in the
current directory. A debugger can be used to determine the
state of the program at the time of the fault.
Programs which are looping, which produce unwanted
output, or about which the user has second thoughts may be
halted by the use of the interrupt signal, which is generated
by typing the “delete” character. Unless special action has
been taken, this signal simply causes the program to cease
execution without producing a core image file.
There is also a quit signal which is used to force a core
image to be produced. Thus programs which loop unexpectedly may be halted and the core image examined without prearrangement.
The hardware-generated faults and the interrupt and
quit signals can, by request, be either ignored or caught by
the process. For example, the Shell ignores quits to prevent
a quit from logging the user out. The editor catches interrupts and returns to its command level. This is useful for
stopping long printouts without losing work in progress (the
editor manipulates a copy of the file it is editing). In systems without floating point hardware, unimplemented
instructions are caught, and floating point instructions are
interpreted.
8. Perspective
Perhaps paradoxically, the success of UNIX is largely
due to the fact that it was not designed to meet any predefined objectives. The first version was written when one
of us (Thompson), dissatisfied with the available computer
374 Electronic version recreated by Eric A. Brewer
University of California at Berkeley
Communications July 1974
of Volume 17
the ACM Number 7
facilities, discovered a little-used system PDP-7 and set out
to create a more hospitable environment. This essentially
personal effort was sufficiently successful to gain the interest of the remaining author and others, and later to justify
the acquisition of the PDP-11/20, specifically to support a
text editing and formatting system. Then in turn the 11/20
was outgrown, UNIX had proved useful enough to persuade
management to invest in the PDP-11/45. Our goals throughout the effort, when articulated at all, have always concerned themselves with building a comfortable relationship
with the machine and with exploring ideas and inventions
in operating systems. We have not been faced with the need
to satisfy someone else’s requirements, and for this freedom
we are grateful.
Three considerations which influenced the design of
UNIX are visible in retrospect.
First, since we are programmers, we naturally designed
the system to make it easy to write, test, and run programs.
The most important expression of our desire for programming convenience was that the system was arranged for
interactive use, even though the original version only supported one user. We believe that a properly designed interactive system is much more productive and satisfying to use
than a “batch” system. Moreover such a system is rather
easily adaptable to noninteractive use, while the converse is
not true.
Second there have always been fairly severe size constraints on the system and its software. Given the partiality
antagonistic desires for reasonable efficiency and expressive power, the size constraint has encouraged not only
economy but a certain elegance of design. This may be a
thinly disguised version of the “salvation through suffering” philosophy, but in our case it worked.
Third, nearly from the start, the system was able to, and
did, maintain itself. This fact is more important than it
might seem. If designers of a system are forced to use that
system, they quickly become aware of its functional and
superficial deficiencies and are strongly motivated to correct them before it is too late. Since all source programs
were always available and easily modified on-line, we were
willing to revise and rewrite the system and its software
when new ideas were invented, discovered, or suggested by
others.
The aspects of UNIX discussed in this paper exhibit
clearly at least the first two of these design considerations.
The interface to the file system, for example, is extremely
convenient from a programming standpoint. The lowest
possible interface level is designed to eliminate distinctions
between the various devices and files and between direct
and sequential access. No large ‘‘access method” routines
are required to insulate the programmer from the system
calls; in fact, all user programs either call the system
directly or use a small library program, only tens of instructions long, which buffers a number of characters and reads
or writes them all at once.
Another important aspect of programming convenience is that there are no “control blocks” with a complicated structure partially maintained by and depended on by
the file system or other system calls. Generally speaking,
the contents of a program’s address space are the property
of the program, and we have tried to avoid placing restrictions on the data structures within that address space.
Given the requirement that all programs should be
usable with any file or device as input or output, it is also
desirable from a space-efficiency standpoint to push
device-dependent considerations into the operating system
itself. The only alternatives seem to be to load routines for
dealing with each device with all programs, which is expensive in space, or to depend on some means of dynamically
linking to the routine appropriate to each device when it is
actually needed, which is expensive either in overhead or in
hardware.
Likewise, the process control scheme and command
interface have proved both convenient and efficient. Since
the Shell operates as an ordinary, swappable user program,
it consumes no wired-down space in the system proper, and
it may be made as powerful as desired at little cost, In particular, given the framework in which the Shell executes as
a process which spawns other processes to perform commands, the notions of I/O redirection, background processes, command files, and user-selectable system
interfaces all become essentially trivial to implement.
8.1 Influences
The success of UNIX lies not so much in new inventions
but rather in the full exploitation of a carefully selected set
of fertile ideas, and especially in showing that they can be
keys to the implementation of a small yet powerful operating system.
The fork operation, essentially as we implemented it,
was present in the Berkeley time-sharing system [8]. On a
number of points we were influenced by Multics, which
suggested the particular form of the I/O system calls [9] and
both the name of the Shell and its general functions, The
notion that the Shell should create a process for each command was also suggested to us by the early design of Multics, although in that system it was later dropped for
efficiency reasons. A similar scheme is used by TENEX [10].
9. Statistics
The following statistics from UNIX are presented to
show the scale of the system and to show how a system of
this scale is used. Those of our users not involved in document preparation tend to use the system for program development, especially language work. There are few important
“applications” programs.

9.5 Reliability
Our statistics on reliability are much more subjective
than the others. The following results are true to the best of
our combined recollections. The time span is over one year
with a very early vintage 11/45.
There has been one loss of a file system (one disk out
of five) caused by software inability to cope with a hard
ware problem causing repeated power fail traps. Files on
that disk were backed up three days.
A “crash” is an unscheduled system reboot or halt.
There is about one crash every other day; about two-thirds
of them are caused by hardware-related difficulties such as
power dips and inexplicable processor interrupts to random
locations. The remainder are software failures. The longest
uninterrupted up time was about two weeks. Service calls
average one every three weeks, but are heavily clustered.
Total up time has been about 98 percent of our 24-hour,
365-day schedule.

 CHAPTER ONE
 The Boy Who Lived
 M r and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
 Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s

sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
 When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
 None of them noticed a large tawny owl fl utter past the
window.
 At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’
chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked
his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing

THE BOY WHO LIVED
on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It
stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading
the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little
shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he
was hoping to get that day.
 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffi c jam, he
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t
bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get- ups you saw
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new
fashion. He drummed his fi ngers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why,
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were
obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
The traffi c moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley
arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
 Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his
offi ce on the ninth fl oor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it

harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the
owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in
the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl
even at night- time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl- free morning. He yelled at fi ve different people.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy
himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.
 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he
couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past
them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
 ‘ The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’
 ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’
 Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear fl ooded him. He looked
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
them, but thought better of it.
 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his offi ce,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone and had almost fi nished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking … no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there

THE BOY WHO LIVED
were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs
Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
afternoon, and when he left the building at fi ve o’clock, he
was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just
outside the door.
 ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary,
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice
that made passers- by stare: ‘Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be
celebrating, this happy, happy day!’
 And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle
and walked off.
 Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged
by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which
he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the fi rst
thing he saw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby
cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings
around its eyes.
 ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.
 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this
normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over
dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he
went into the living- room in time to catch the last report on
the evening news:
 ‘And fi nally, bird- watchers everywhere have reported that
the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of
these birds fl ying in every direction since sunrise. Experts
are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself
a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffi n with
the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?’
 ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that,
but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised
yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
people have been celebrating Bonfi re Night early – it’s not
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’
 Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all
over Britain? Owls fl ying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the
Potters …
 Mrs Dursley came into the living- room carrying two cups
of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t
heard from your sister lately, have you?’
 As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a
sister.
 ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’
 ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …
shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny- looking people
in town today …’
‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.
 ‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do
with … you know … her lot .’
 Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually
as he could, ‘ Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now,
wouldn’t he?’

 ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffl y.
 ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’
 ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’
 ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes,
I quite agree.’
 He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went
upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into
the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down
Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something.
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to
do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were
related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly
but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if
the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to
come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind …
He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over.
It couldn’t affect them …
 How very wrong he was.
 Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fi xed
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,

THE BOY WHO LIVED
nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
eyes narrowed.
 Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
and muttered, ‘I should have known.’
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
28493.indb 9 8493.indb 9 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
a moment he spoke to it.
 ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he
was smiling at a rather severe- looking woman who was
wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the
cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an
emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruffl ed.
 ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.
 ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffl y.’
 ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’
said Professor McGonagall.
 ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
 ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no –
even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was
on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark
living- room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting
stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound

THE BOY WHO LIVED
to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’
 ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’
 ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But
that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed
in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fi ne thing it would be if, on the very
day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?’
 ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to
be thankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’
 ‘A what ?’
 ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.’
 ‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as
though she didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet
lemons. ‘As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone –’
 ‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself
can call him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort .’ Professor McGonagall fl inched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing
28493.indb 11 8493.indb 11 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

12
if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’
 ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding
half- exasperated, half- admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right,
Voldemort – was frightened of.’
 ‘You fl atter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had
powers I will never have.’
 ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’
 ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore
and said, ‘ The owls are nothing to the rumours that are fl ying
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s
disappeared? About what fi nally stopped him?’
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat
nor as a woman had she fi xed Dumbledore with such a piercing
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
sherbet lemon and did not answer.
 ‘What they’re saying ,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night
Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to fi nd the
Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
that they’re – dead .’
 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
 ‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to
believe it … Oh, Albus …’
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I
know … I know …’ he said heavily.
 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
‘ That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son,
Harry. But – he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No
one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he
couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’
 Dumbledore nodded glumly.
 ‘It’s – it’s true ?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s
done … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little
boy? It’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’
 ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never
know.’
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore,
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?’
 ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose
you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’

 ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
only family he has left now.’
 ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here ?’
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing
at number four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t fi nd two people who are less like us.
And they’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!’
 ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore fi rmly. ‘His
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when
he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.’
 ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting
back down on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you
can explain all this in a letter? These people will never
understand him! He’ll be famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future –
there will be books written about Harry – every child in our
world will know his name!’
 ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the
top of his half- moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any
boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much
better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s
ready to take it?’
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of
course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She

eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be
hiding Harry underneath it.
 ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’
 ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?’
 ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.
 ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to – what was that?’
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the
street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they
both looked up at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of
the air and landed on the road in front of them.
 If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man
and at least fi ve times as wide. He looked simply too big to
be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
 ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And
where did you get that motorbike?’
 ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,
climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius
Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’
 ‘No problems, were there?’
28493.indb 15 8493.indb 15 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

16
 ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was fl yin’ over Bristol.’
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
 ‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.
 ‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’
 ‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’
 ‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the
London Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d
better get this over with.’
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards
the Dursleys’ house.
 ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
 ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the
Muggles!’
 ‘S-s- sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c- c-can’t stand
it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with
Muggles –’
 ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid,
or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the
low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry
gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked
it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that
usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone
out.
 ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore fi nally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.’
 ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffl ed voice. ‘I’d best get this
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor
Dumbledore, sir.’
 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
 ‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He
clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their
street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and
he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of
blankets on the step of number four.

 ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel
and with a swish of his cloak he was gone.
 A breeze ruffl ed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small
hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the
milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley … He
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and
saying in hushed voices: ‘ To Harry Potter – the boy who
lived!’

 CHAPTER ONE
 The Boy Who Lived
 M r and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
 Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s
28493.indb 1 8493.indb 1 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
 When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
 None of them noticed a large tawny owl fl utter past the
window.
 At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’
chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked
his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing

THE BOY WHO LIVED
on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It
stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading
the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little
shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he
was hoping to get that day.
 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffi c jam, he
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t
bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get- ups you saw
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new
fashion. He drummed his fi ngers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why,
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were
obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
The traffi c moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley
arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
 Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his
offi ce on the ninth fl oor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it

harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the
owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in
the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl
even at night- time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl- free morning. He yelled at fi ve different people.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy
himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.
 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he
couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past
them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
 ‘ The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’
 ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’
 Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear fl ooded him. He looked
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
them, but thought better of it.
 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his offi ce,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone and had almost fi nished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking … no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there

THE BOY WHO LIVED
were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs
Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
afternoon, and when he left the building at fi ve o’clock, he
was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just
outside the door.
 ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary,
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice
that made passers- by stare: ‘Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be
celebrating, this happy, happy day!’
 And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle
and walked off.
 Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged
by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which
he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the fi rst
thing he saw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby
cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings
around its eyes.
 ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.
 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this
normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over
dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he
went into the living- room in time to catch the last report on
the evening news:
 ‘And fi nally, bird- watchers everywhere have reported that
the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of
these birds fl ying in every direction since sunrise. Experts
are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself
a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffi n with
the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?’
 ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that,
but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised
yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
people have been celebrating Bonfi re Night early – it’s not
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’
 Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all
over Britain? Owls fl ying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the
Potters …
 Mrs Dursley came into the living- room carrying two cups
of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t
heard from your sister lately, have you?’
 As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a
sister.
 ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’
 ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …
shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny- looking people
in town today …’
‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.
 ‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do
with … you know … her lot .’
 Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually
as he could, ‘ Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now,
wouldn’t he?’

 ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffl y.
 ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’
 ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’
 ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes,
I quite agree.’
 He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went
upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into
the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down
Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something.
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to
do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were
related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly
but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if
the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to
come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind …
He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over.
It couldn’t affect them …
 How very wrong he was.
 Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fi xed
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,

THE BOY WHO LIVED
nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
eyes narrowed.
 Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
and muttered, ‘I should have known.’
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
28493.indb 9 8493.indb 9 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
a moment he spoke to it.
 ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he
was smiling at a rather severe- looking woman who was
wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the
cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an
emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruffl ed.
 ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.
 ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffl y.’
 ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’
said Professor McGonagall.
 ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
 ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no –
even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was
on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark
living- room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting
stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound

THE BOY WHO LIVED
to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’
 ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’
 ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But
that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed
in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fi ne thing it would be if, on the very
day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?’
 ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to
be thankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’
 ‘A what ?’
 ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.’
 ‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as
though she didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet
lemons. ‘As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone –’
 ‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself
can call him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort .’ Professor McGonagall fl inched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing
28493.indb 11 8493.indb 11 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36
HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE
12
if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’
 ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding
half- exasperated, half- admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right,
Voldemort – was frightened of.’
 ‘You fl atter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had
powers I will never have.’
 ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’
 ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore
and said, ‘ The owls are nothing to the rumours that are fl ying
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s
disappeared? About what fi nally stopped him?’
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat
nor as a woman had she fi xed Dumbledore with such a piercing
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
sherbet lemon and did not answer.
 ‘What they’re saying ,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night
Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to fi nd the
Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
that they’re – dead .’
 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
 ‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to
believe it … Oh, Albus …’
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I
know … I know …’ he said heavily.
 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
‘ That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son,
Harry. But – he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No
one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he
couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’
 Dumbledore nodded glumly.
 ‘It’s – it’s true ?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s
done … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little
boy? It’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’
 ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never
know.’
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore,
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?’
 ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose
you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’

 ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
only family he has left now.’
 ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here ?’
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing
at number four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t fi nd two people who are less like us.
And they’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!’
 ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore fi rmly. ‘His
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when
he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.’
 ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting
back down on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you
can explain all this in a letter? These people will never
understand him! He’ll be famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future –
there will be books written about Harry – every child in our
world will know his name!’
 ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the
top of his half- moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any
boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much
better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s
ready to take it?’
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of
course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She

eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be
hiding Harry underneath it.
 ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’
 ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?’
 ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.
 ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to – what was that?’
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the
street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they
both looked up at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of
the air and landed on the road in front of them.
 If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man
and at least fi ve times as wide. He looked simply too big to
be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
 ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And
where did you get that motorbike?’
 ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,
climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius
Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’
 ‘No problems, were there?’
28493.indb 15 8493.indb 15 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

16
 ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was fl yin’ over Bristol.’
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
 ‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.
 ‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’
 ‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’
 ‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the
London Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d
better get this over with.’
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards
the Dursleys’ house.
 ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
 ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the
Muggles!’
 ‘S-s- sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c- c-can’t stand
it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with
Muggles –’
 ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid,
or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the
low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry
gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked
it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that
usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone
out.
 ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore fi nally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.’
 ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffl ed voice. ‘I’d best get this
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor
Dumbledore, sir.’
 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
 ‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He
clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their
street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and
he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of
blankets on the step of number four.

 ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel
and with a swish of his cloak he was gone.
 A breeze ruffl ed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small
hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the
milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley … He
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and
saying in hushed voices: ‘ To Harry Potter – the boy who
lived!’

 CHAPTER ONE
 The Boy Who Lived
 M r and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
 Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s
28493.indb 1 8493.indb 1 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
 When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
 None of them noticed a large tawny owl fl utter past the
window.
 At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’
chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked
his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing

THE BOY WHO LIVED
on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It
stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading
the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little
shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he
was hoping to get that day.
 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffi c jam, he
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t
bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get- ups you saw
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new
fashion. He drummed his fi ngers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why,
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were
obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
The traffi c moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley
arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
 Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his
offi ce on the ninth fl oor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it

harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the
owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in
the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl
even at night- time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl- free morning. He yelled at fi ve different people.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy
himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.
 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he
couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past
them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
 ‘ The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’
 ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’
 Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear fl ooded him. He looked
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
them, but thought better of it.
 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his offi ce,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone and had almost fi nished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking … no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there

THE BOY WHO LIVED
were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs
Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
afternoon, and when he left the building at fi ve o’clock, he
was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just
outside the door.
 ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary,
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice
that made passers- by stare: ‘Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be
celebrating, this happy, happy day!’
 And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle
and walked off.
 Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged
by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which
he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the fi rst
thing he saw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby
cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings
around its eyes.
 ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.
 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this
normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over
dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he
went into the living- room in time to catch the last report on
the evening news:
 ‘And fi nally, bird- watchers everywhere have reported that
the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of
these birds fl ying in every direction since sunrise. Experts
are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself
a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffi n with
the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?’
 ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that,
but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised
yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
people have been celebrating Bonfi re Night early – it’s not
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’
 Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all
over Britain? Owls fl ying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the
Potters …
 Mrs Dursley came into the living- room carrying two cups
of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t
heard from your sister lately, have you?’
 As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a
sister.
 ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’
 ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …
shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny- looking people
in town today …’
‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.
 ‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do
with … you know … her lot .’
 Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually
as he could, ‘ Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now,
wouldn’t he?’
28493.indb 7 8493.indb 7 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

 ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffl y.
 ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’
 ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’
 ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes,
I quite agree.’
 He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went
upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into
the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down
Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something.
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to
do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were
related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly
but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if
the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to
come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind …
He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over.
It couldn’t affect them …
 How very wrong he was.
 Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fi xed
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,

THE BOY WHO LIVED
nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
eyes narrowed.
 Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
and muttered, ‘I should have known.’
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
28493.indb 9 8493.indb 9 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
a moment he spoke to it.
 ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he
was smiling at a rather severe- looking woman who was
wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the
cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an
emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruffl ed.
 ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.
 ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffl y.’
 ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’
said Professor McGonagall.
 ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
 ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no –
even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was
on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark
living- room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting
stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound

THE BOY WHO LIVED
to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’
 ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’
 ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But
that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed
in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fi ne thing it would be if, on the very
day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?’
 ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to
be thankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’
 ‘A what ?’
 ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.’
 ‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as
though she didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet
lemons. ‘As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone –’
 ‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself
can call him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort .’ Professor McGonagall fl inched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing
28493.indb 11 8493.indb 11 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

12
if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’
 ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding
half- exasperated, half- admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right,
Voldemort – was frightened of.’
 ‘You fl atter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had
powers I will never have.’
 ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’
 ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore
and said, ‘ The owls are nothing to the rumours that are fl ying
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s
disappeared? About what fi nally stopped him?’
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat
nor as a woman had she fi xed Dumbledore with such a piercing
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
sherbet lemon and did not answer.
 ‘What they’re saying ,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night
Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to fi nd the
Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
that they’re – dead .’
 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

13
THE BOY WHO LIVED
 ‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to
believe it … Oh, Albus …’
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I
know … I know …’ he said heavily.
 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
‘ That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son,
Harry. But – he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No
one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he
couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’
 Dumbledore nodded glumly.
 ‘It’s – it’s true ?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s
done … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little
boy? It’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’
 ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never
know.’
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore,
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?’
 ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose
you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’

 ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
only family he has left now.’
 ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here ?’
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing
at number four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t fi nd two people who are less like us.
And they’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!’
 ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore fi rmly. ‘His
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when
he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.’
 ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting
back down on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you
can explain all this in a letter? These people will never
understand him! He’ll be famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future –
there will be books written about Harry – every child in our
world will know his name!’
 ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the
top of his half- moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any
boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much
better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s
ready to take it?’
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of
course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She

eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be
hiding Harry underneath it.
 ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’
 ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?’
 ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.
 ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to – what was that?’
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the
street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they
both looked up at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of
the air and landed on the road in front of them.
 If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man
and at least fi ve times as wide. He looked simply too big to
be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
 ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And
where did you get that motorbike?’
 ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,
climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius
Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’
 ‘No problems, were there?’
28493.indb 15 8493.indb 15 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36
HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE
16
 ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was fl yin’ over Bristol.’
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
 ‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.
 ‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’
 ‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’
 ‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the
London Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d
better get this over with.’
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards
the Dursleys’ house.
 ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
 ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the
Muggles!’
 ‘S-s- sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c- c-can’t stand
it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with
Muggles –’
 ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid,
or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the
low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry
gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked
it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that
usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone
out.
 ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore fi nally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.’
 ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffl ed voice. ‘I’d best get this
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor
Dumbledore, sir.’
 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
 ‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He
clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their
street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and
he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of
blankets on the step of number four.

 ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel
and with a swish of his cloak he was gone.
 A breeze ruffl ed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small
hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the
milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley … He
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and
saying in hushed voices: ‘ To Harry Potter – the boy who
lived!’

 CHAPTER ONE
 The Boy Who Lived
 M r and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
 Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s

sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
 When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
 None of them noticed a large tawny owl fl utter past the
window.
 At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’
chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked
his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing

THE BOY WHO LIVED
on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It
stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading
the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little
shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he
was hoping to get that day.
 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffi c jam, he
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t
bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get- ups you saw
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new
fashion. He drummed his fi ngers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why,
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were
obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
The traffi c moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley
arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
 Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his
offi ce on the ninth fl oor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it

harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the
owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in
the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl
even at night- time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl- free morning. He yelled at fi ve different people.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy
himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.
 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he
couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past
them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
 ‘ The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’
 ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’
 Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear fl ooded him. He looked
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
them, but thought better of it.
 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his offi ce,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone and had almost fi nished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking … no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there

THE BOY WHO LIVED
were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs
Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
afternoon, and when he left the building at fi ve o’clock, he
was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just
outside the door.
 ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary,
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice
that made passers- by stare: ‘Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be
celebrating, this happy, happy day!’
 And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle
and walked off.
 Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged
by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which
he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the fi rst
thing he saw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby
cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings
around its eyes.
 ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.
 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this
normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over
dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he
went into the living- room in time to catch the last report on
the evening news:
 ‘And fi nally, bird- watchers everywhere have reported that
the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of
these birds fl ying in every direction since sunrise. Experts
are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself
a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffi n with
the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?’
 ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that,
but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised
yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
people have been celebrating Bonfi re Night early – it’s not
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’
 Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all
over Britain? Owls fl ying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the
Potters …
 Mrs Dursley came into the living- room carrying two cups
of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t
heard from your sister lately, have you?’
 As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a
sister.
 ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’
 ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …
shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny- looking people
in town today …’
‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.
 ‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do
with … you know … her lot .’
 Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually
as he could, ‘ Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now,
wouldn’t he?’

 ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffl y.
 ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’
 ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’
 ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes,
I quite agree.’
 He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went
upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into
the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down
Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something.
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to
do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were
related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly
but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if
the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to
come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind …
He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over.
It couldn’t affect them …
 How very wrong he was.
 Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fi xed
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,

THE BOY WHO LIVED
nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
eyes narrowed.
 Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
and muttered, ‘I should have known.’
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
28493.indb 9 8493.indb 9 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
a moment he spoke to it.
 ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he
was smiling at a rather severe- looking woman who was
wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the
cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an
emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruffl ed.
 ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.
 ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffl y.’
 ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’
said Professor McGonagall.
 ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
 ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no –
even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was
on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark
living- room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting
stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound

THE BOY WHO LIVED
to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’
 ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’
 ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But
that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed
in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fi ne thing it would be if, on the very
day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?’
 ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to
be thankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’
 ‘A what ?’
 ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.’
 ‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as
though she didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet
lemons. ‘As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone –’
 ‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself
can call him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort .’ Professor McGonagall fl inched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing
28493.indb 11 8493.indb 11 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

12
if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’
 ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding
half- exasperated, half- admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right,
Voldemort – was frightened of.’
 ‘You fl atter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had
powers I will never have.’
 ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’
 ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore
and said, ‘ The owls are nothing to the rumours that are fl ying
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s
disappeared? About what fi nally stopped him?’
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat
nor as a woman had she fi xed Dumbledore with such a piercing
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
sherbet lemon and did not answer.
 ‘What they’re saying ,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night
Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to fi nd the
Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
that they’re – dead .’
 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

13
THE BOY WHO LIVED
 ‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to
believe it … Oh, Albus …’
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I
know … I know …’ he said heavily.
 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
‘ That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son,
Harry. But – he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No
one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he
couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’
 Dumbledore nodded glumly.
 ‘It’s – it’s true ?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s
done … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little
boy? It’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’
 ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never
know.’
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore,
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?’
 ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose
you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’

 ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
only family he has left now.’
 ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here ?’
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing
at number four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t fi nd two people who are less like us.
And they’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!’
 ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore fi rmly. ‘His
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when
he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.’
 ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting
back down on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you
can explain all this in a letter? These people will never
understand him! He’ll be famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future –
there will be books written about Harry – every child in our
world will know his name!’
 ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the
top of his half- moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any
boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much
better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s
ready to take it?’
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of
course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She

eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be
hiding Harry underneath it.
 ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’
 ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?’
 ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.
 ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to – what was that?’
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the
street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they
both looked up at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of
the air and landed on the road in front of them.
 If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man
and at least fi ve times as wide. He looked simply too big to
be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
 ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And
where did you get that motorbike?’
 ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,
climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius
Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’
 ‘No problems, were there?’
28493.indb 15 8493.indb 15 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36
HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE
16
 ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was fl yin’ over Bristol.’
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
 ‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.
 ‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’
 ‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’
 ‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the
London Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d
better get this over with.’
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards
the Dursleys’ house.
 ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
 ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the
Muggles!’
 ‘S-s- sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c- c-can’t stand
it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with
Muggles –’
 ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid,
or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the
low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry
gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked
it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that
usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone
out.
 ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore fi nally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.’
 ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffl ed voice. ‘I’d best get this
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor
Dumbledore, sir.’
 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
 ‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He
clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their
street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and
he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of
blankets on the step of number four.

 ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel
and with a swish of his cloak he was gone.
 A breeze ruffl ed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small
hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the
milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley … He
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and
saying in hushed voices: ‘ To Harry Potter – the boy who
lived!’

 CHAPTER ONE
 The Boy Who Lived
 M r and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
 Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s
28493.indb 1 8493.indb 1 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
 When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
 None of them noticed a large tawny owl fl utter past the
window.
 At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’
chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked
his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing

THE BOY WHO LIVED
on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It
stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading
the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little
shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he
was hoping to get that day.
 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffi c jam, he
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t
bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get- ups you saw
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new
fashion. He drummed his fi ngers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why,
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were
obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
The traffi c moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley
arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
 Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his
offi ce on the ninth fl oor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it

harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the
owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in
the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl
even at night- time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl- free morning. He yelled at fi ve different people.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy
himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.
 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he
couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past
them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
 ‘ The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’
 ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’
 Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear fl ooded him. He looked
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
them, but thought better of it.
 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his offi ce,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone and had almost fi nished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking … no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there

THE BOY WHO LIVED
were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs
Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
afternoon, and when he left the building at fi ve o’clock, he
was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just
outside the door.
 ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary,
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice
that made passers- by stare: ‘Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be
celebrating, this happy, happy day!’
 And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle
and walked off.
 Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged
by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which
he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the fi rst
thing he saw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby
cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings
around its eyes.
 ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.
 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this
normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over
dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he
went into the living- room in time to catch the last report on
the evening news:
 ‘And fi nally, bird- watchers everywhere have reported that
the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of
these birds fl ying in every direction since sunrise. Experts
are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself
a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffi n with
the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?’
 ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that,
but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised
yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
people have been celebrating Bonfi re Night early – it’s not
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’
 Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all
over Britain? Owls fl ying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the
Potters …
 Mrs Dursley came into the living- room carrying two cups
of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t
heard from your sister lately, have you?’
 As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a
sister.
 ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’
 ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …
shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny- looking people
in town today …’
‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.
 ‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do
with … you know … her lot .’
 Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually
as he could, ‘ Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now,
wouldn’t he?’

 ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffl y.
 ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’
 ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’
 ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes,
I quite agree.’
 He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went
upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into
the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down
Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something.
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to
do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were
related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly
but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if
the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to
come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind …
He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over.
It couldn’t affect them …
 How very wrong he was.
 Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fi xed
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,

THE BOY WHO LIVED
nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
eyes narrowed.
 Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
and muttered, ‘I should have known.’
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
28493.indb 9 8493.indb 9 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
a moment he spoke to it.
 ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he
was smiling at a rather severe- looking woman who was
wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the
cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an
emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruffl ed.
 ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.
 ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffl y.’
 ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’
said Professor McGonagall.
 ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
 ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no –
even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was
on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark
living- room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting
stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound

THE BOY WHO LIVED
to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’
 ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’
 ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But
that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed
in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fi ne thing it would be if, on the very
day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?’
 ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to
be thankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’
 ‘A what ?’
 ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.’
 ‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as
though she didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet
lemons. ‘As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone –’
 ‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself
can call him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort .’ Professor McGonagall fl inched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing
28493.indb 11 8493.indb 11 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

12
if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’
 ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding
half- exasperated, half- admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right,
Voldemort – was frightened of.’
 ‘You fl atter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had
powers I will never have.’
 ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’
 ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore
and said, ‘ The owls are nothing to the rumours that are fl ying
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s
disappeared? About what fi nally stopped him?’
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat
nor as a woman had she fi xed Dumbledore with such a piercing
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
sherbet lemon and did not answer.
 ‘What they’re saying ,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night
Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to fi nd the
Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
that they’re – dead .’
 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
 ‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to
believe it … Oh, Albus …’
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I
know … I know …’ he said heavily.
 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
‘ That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son,
Harry. But – he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No
one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he
couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’
 Dumbledore nodded glumly.
 ‘It’s – it’s true ?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s
done … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little
boy? It’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’
 ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never
know.’
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore,
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?’
 ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose
you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’

 ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
only family he has left now.’
 ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here ?’
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing
at number four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t fi nd two people who are less like us.
And they’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!’
 ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore fi rmly. ‘His
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when
he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.’
 ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting
back down on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you
can explain all this in a letter? These people will never
understand him! He’ll be famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future –
there will be books written about Harry – every child in our
world will know his name!’
 ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the
top of his half- moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any
boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much
better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s
ready to take it?’
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of
course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She

eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be
hiding Harry underneath it.
 ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’
 ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?’
 ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.
 ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to – what was that?’
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the
street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they
both looked up at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of
the air and landed on the road in front of them.
 If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man
and at least fi ve times as wide. He looked simply too big to
be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
 ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And
where did you get that motorbike?’
 ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,
climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius
Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’
 ‘No problems, were there?’
28493.indb 15 8493.indb 15 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36
HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE
16
 ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was fl yin’ over Bristol.’
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
 ‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.
 ‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’
 ‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’
 ‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the
London Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d
better get this over with.’
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards
the Dursleys’ house.
 ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
 ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the
Muggles!’
 ‘S-s- sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c- c-can’t stand
it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with
Muggles –’
 ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid,
or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the
low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry
gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked
it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that
usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone
out.
 ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore fi nally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.’
 ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffl ed voice. ‘I’d best get this
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor
Dumbledore, sir.’
 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
 ‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He
clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their
street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and
he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of
blankets on the step of number four.

 ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel
and with a swish of his cloak he was gone.
 A breeze ruffl ed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small
hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the
milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley … He
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and
saying in hushed voices: ‘ To Harry Potter – the boy who
lived!’

 CHAPTER ONE
 The Boy Who Lived
 M r and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
 Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s

sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
 When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
 None of them noticed a large tawny owl fl utter past the
window.
 At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’
chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked
his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing

THE BOY WHO LIVED
on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It
stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading
the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little
shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he
was hoping to get that day.
 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffi c jam, he
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t
bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get- ups you saw
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new
fashion. He drummed his fi ngers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why,
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were
obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
The traffi c moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley
arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
 Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his
offi ce on the ninth fl oor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it

harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the
owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in
the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl
even at night- time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl- free morning. He yelled at fi ve different people.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy
himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.
 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he
couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past
them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
 ‘ The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’
 ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’
 Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear fl ooded him. He looked
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
them, but thought better of it.
 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his offi ce,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone and had almost fi nished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking … no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there

THE BOY WHO LIVED
were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs
Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
afternoon, and when he left the building at fi ve o’clock, he
was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just
outside the door.
 ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary,
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice
that made passers- by stare: ‘Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be
celebrating, this happy, happy day!’
 And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle
and walked off.
 Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged
by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which
he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the fi rst
thing he saw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby
cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings
around its eyes.
 ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.
 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this
normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over
dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he
went into the living- room in time to catch the last report on
the evening news:
 ‘And fi nally, bird- watchers everywhere have reported that
the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of
these birds fl ying in every direction since sunrise. Experts
are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself
a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffi n with
the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?’
 ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that,
but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised
yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
people have been celebrating Bonfi re Night early – it’s not
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’
 Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all
over Britain? Owls fl ying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the
Potters …
 Mrs Dursley came into the living- room carrying two cups
of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t
heard from your sister lately, have you?’
 As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a
sister.
 ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’
 ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …
shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny- looking people
in town today …’
‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.
 ‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do
with … you know … her lot .’
 Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually
as he could, ‘ Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now,
wouldn’t he?’

 ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffl y.
 ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’
 ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’
 ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes,
I quite agree.’
 He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went
upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into
the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down
Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something.
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to
do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were
related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly
but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if
the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to
come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind …
He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over.
It couldn’t affect them …
 How very wrong he was.
 Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fi xed
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,

THE BOY WHO LIVED
nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
eyes narrowed.
 Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
and muttered, ‘I should have known.’
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
28493.indb 9 8493.indb 9 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
a moment he spoke to it.
 ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he
was smiling at a rather severe- looking woman who was
wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the
cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an
emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruffl ed.
 ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.
 ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffl y.’
 ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’
said Professor McGonagall.
 ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
 ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no –
even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was
on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark
living- room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting
stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound

THE BOY WHO LIVED
to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’
 ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’
 ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But
that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed
in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fi ne thing it would be if, on the very
day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?’
 ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to
be thankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’
 ‘A what ?’
 ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.’
 ‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as
though she didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet
lemons. ‘As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone –’
 ‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself
can call him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort .’ Professor McGonagall fl inched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing
28493.indb 11 8493.indb 11 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

12
if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’
 ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding
half- exasperated, half- admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right,
Voldemort – was frightened of.’
 ‘You fl atter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had
powers I will never have.’
 ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’
 ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore
and said, ‘ The owls are nothing to the rumours that are fl ying
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s
disappeared? About what fi nally stopped him?’
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat
nor as a woman had she fi xed Dumbledore with such a piercing
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
sherbet lemon and did not answer.
 ‘What they’re saying ,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night
Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to fi nd the
Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
that they’re – dead .’
 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
 ‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to
believe it … Oh, Albus …’
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I
know … I know …’ he said heavily.
 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
‘ That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son,
Harry. But – he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No
one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he
couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’
 Dumbledore nodded glumly.
 ‘It’s – it’s true ?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s
done … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little
boy? It’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’
 ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never
know.’
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore,
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?’
 ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose
you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’

 ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
only family he has left now.’
 ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here ?’
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing
at number four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t fi nd two people who are less like us.
And they’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!’
 ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore fi rmly. ‘His
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when
he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.’
 ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting
back down on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you
can explain all this in a letter? These people will never
understand him! He’ll be famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future –
there will be books written about Harry – every child in our
world will know his name!’
 ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the
top of his half- moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any
boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much
better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s
ready to take it?’
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of
course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She

eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be
hiding Harry underneath it.
 ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’
 ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?’
 ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.
 ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to – what was that?’
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the
street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they
both looked up at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of
the air and landed on the road in front of them.
 If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man
and at least fi ve times as wide. He looked simply too big to
be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
 ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And
where did you get that motorbike?’
 ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,
climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius
Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’
 ‘No problems, were there?’
28493.indb 15 8493.indb 15 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

16
 ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was fl yin’ over Bristol.’
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
 ‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.
 ‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’
 ‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’
 ‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the
London Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d
better get this over with.’
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards
the Dursleys’ house.
 ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
 ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the
Muggles!’
 ‘S-s- sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c- c-can’t stand
it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with
Muggles –’
 ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid,
or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the
low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry
gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked
it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that
usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone
out.
 ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore fi nally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.’
 ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffl ed voice. ‘I’d best get this
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor
Dumbledore, sir.’
 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
 ‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He
clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their
street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and
he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of
blankets on the step of number four.

 ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel
and with a swish of his cloak he was gone.
 A breeze ruffl ed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small
hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the
milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley … He
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and
saying in hushed voices: ‘ To Harry Potter – the boy who
lived!’

 CHAPTER ONE
 The Boy Who Lived
 M r and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
 Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s

sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
 When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
 None of them noticed a large tawny owl fl utter past the
window.
 At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’
chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked
his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing

THE BOY WHO LIVED
on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It
stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading
the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little
shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he
was hoping to get that day.
 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffi c jam, he
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t
bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get- ups you saw
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new
fashion. He drummed his fi ngers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why,
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were
obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
The traffi c moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley
arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
 Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his
offi ce on the ninth fl oor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it

harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the
owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in
the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl
even at night- time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl- free morning. He yelled at fi ve different people.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy
himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.
 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he
couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past
them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
 ‘ The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’
 ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’
 Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear fl ooded him. He looked
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
them, but thought better of it.
 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his offi ce,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone and had almost fi nished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking … no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there

THE BOY WHO LIVED
were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs
Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
afternoon, and when he left the building at fi ve o’clock, he
was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just
outside the door.
 ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary,
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice
that made passers- by stare: ‘Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be
celebrating, this happy, happy day!’
 And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle
and walked off.
 Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged
by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which
he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the fi rst
thing he saw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby
cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings
around its eyes.
 ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.
 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this
normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over
dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he
went into the living- room in time to catch the last report on
the evening news:
 ‘And fi nally, bird- watchers everywhere have reported that
the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of
these birds fl ying in every direction since sunrise. Experts
are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself
a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffi n with
the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?’
 ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that,
but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised
yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
people have been celebrating Bonfi re Night early – it’s not
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’
 Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all
over Britain? Owls fl ying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the
Potters …
 Mrs Dursley came into the living- room carrying two cups
of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t
heard from your sister lately, have you?’
 As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a
sister.
 ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’
 ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …
shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny- looking people
in town today …’
‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.
 ‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do
with … you know … her lot .’
 Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually
as he could, ‘ Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now,
wouldn’t he?’

 ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffl y.
 ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’
 ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’
 ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes,
I quite agree.’
 He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went
upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into
the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down
Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something.
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to
do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were
related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly
but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if
the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to
come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind …
He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over.
It couldn’t affect them …
 How very wrong he was.
 Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fi xed
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,

THE BOY WHO LIVED
nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
eyes narrowed.
 Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
and muttered, ‘I should have known.’
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
28493.indb 9 8493.indb 9 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
a moment he spoke to it.
 ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he
was smiling at a rather severe- looking woman who was
wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the
cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an
emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruffl ed.
 ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.
 ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffl y.’
 ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’
said Professor McGonagall.
 ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
 ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no –
even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was
on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark
living- room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting
stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound

to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’
 ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’
 ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But
that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed
in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fi ne thing it would be if, on the very
day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?’
 ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to
be thankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’
 ‘A what ?’
 ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.’
 ‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as
though she didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet
lemons. ‘As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone –’
 ‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself
can call him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort .’ Professor McGonagall fl inched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing
28493.indb 11 8493.indb 11 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

12
if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’
 ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding
half- exasperated, half- admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right,
Voldemort – was frightened of.’
 ‘You fl atter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had
powers I will never have.’
 ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’
 ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore
and said, ‘ The owls are nothing to the rumours that are fl ying
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s
disappeared? About what fi nally stopped him?’
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat
nor as a woman had she fi xed Dumbledore with such a piercing
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
sherbet lemon and did not answer.
 ‘What they’re saying ,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night
Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to fi nd the
Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
that they’re – dead .’
 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
 ‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to
believe it … Oh, Albus …’
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I
know … I know …’ he said heavily.
 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
‘ That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son,
Harry. But – he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No
one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he
couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’
 Dumbledore nodded glumly.
 ‘It’s – it’s true ?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s
done … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little
boy? It’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’
 ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never
know.’
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore,
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?’
 ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose
you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’

 ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
only family he has left now.’
 ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here ?’
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing
at number four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t fi nd two people who are less like us.
And they’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!’
 ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore fi rmly. ‘His
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when
he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.’
 ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting
back down on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you
can explain all this in a letter? These people will never
understand him! He’ll be famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future –
there will be books written about Harry – every child in our
world will know his name!’
 ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the
top of his half- moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any
boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much
better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s
ready to take it?’
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of
course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She

eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be
hiding Harry underneath it.
 ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’
 ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?’
 ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.
 ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to – what was that?’
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the
street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they
both looked up at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of
the air and landed on the road in front of them.
 If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man
and at least fi ve times as wide. He looked simply too big to
be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
 ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And
where did you get that motorbike?’
 ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,
climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius
Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’
 ‘No problems, were there?’
28493.indb 15 8493.indb 15 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

 ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was fl yin’ over Bristol.’
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
 ‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.
 ‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’
 ‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’
 ‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the
London Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d
better get this over with.’
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards
the Dursleys’ house.
 ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
 ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the
Muggles!’
 ‘S-s- sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c- c-can’t stand
it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with
Muggles –’
 ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid,
or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the
low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry
gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked
it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that
usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone
out.
 ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore fi nally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.’
 ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffl ed voice. ‘I’d best get this
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor
Dumbledore, sir.’
 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
 ‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He
clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their
street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and
he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of
blankets on the step of number four.

 ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel
and with a swish of his cloak he was gone.
 A breeze ruffl ed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small
hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the
milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley … He
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and
saying in hushed voices: ‘ To Harry Potter – the boy who
lived!’

 CHAPTER ONE
 The Boy Who Lived
 M r and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
 Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s

sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
 When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
 None of them noticed a large tawny owl fl utter past the
window.
 At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’
chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked
his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing

THE BOY WHO LIVED
on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It
stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading
the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little
shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he
was hoping to get that day.
 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffi c jam, he
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t
bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get- ups you saw
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new
fashion. He drummed his fi ngers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why,
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were
obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
The traffi c moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley
arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
 Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his
offi ce on the ninth fl oor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it

harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the
owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in
the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl
even at night- time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl- free morning. He yelled at fi ve different people.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy
himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.
 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he
couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past
them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
 ‘ The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’
 ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’
 Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear fl ooded him. He looked
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
them, but thought better of it.
 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his offi ce,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone and had almost fi nished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking … no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there

THE BOY WHO LIVED
were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs
Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
afternoon, and when he left the building at fi ve o’clock, he
was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just
outside the door.
 ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary,
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice
that made passers- by stare: ‘Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be
celebrating, this happy, happy day!’
 And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle
and walked off.
 Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged
by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which
he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the fi rst
thing he saw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby
cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings
around its eyes.
 ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.
 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this
normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over
dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he
went into the living- room in time to catch the last report on
the evening news:
 ‘And fi nally, bird- watchers everywhere have reported that
the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of
these birds fl ying in every direction since sunrise. Experts
are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself
a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffi n with
the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?’
 ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that,
but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised
yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
people have been celebrating Bonfi re Night early – it’s not
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’
 Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all
over Britain? Owls fl ying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the
Potters …
 Mrs Dursley came into the living- room carrying two cups
of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t
heard from your sister lately, have you?’
 As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a
sister.
 ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’
 ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …
shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny- looking people
in town today …’
‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.
 ‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do
with … you know … her lot .’
 Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually
as he could, ‘ Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now,
wouldn’t he?’
28493.indb 7 8493.indb 7 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

 ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffl y.
 ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’
 ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’
 ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes,
I quite agree.’
 He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went
upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into
the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down
Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something.
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to
do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were
related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly
but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if
the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to
come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind …
He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over.
It couldn’t affect them …
 How very wrong he was.
 Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fi xed
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,

THE BOY WHO LIVED
nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
eyes narrowed.
 Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
and muttered, ‘I should have known.’
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
28493.indb 9 8493.indb 9 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
a moment he spoke to it.
 ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he
was smiling at a rather severe- looking woman who was
wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the
cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an
emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruffl ed.
 ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.
 ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffl y.’
 ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’
said Professor McGonagall.
 ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
 ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no –
even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was
on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark
living- room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting
stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound

THE BOY WHO LIVED
to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’
 ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’
 ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But
that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed
in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fi ne thing it would be if, on the very
day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?’
 ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to
be thankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’
 ‘A what ?’
 ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.’
 ‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as
though she didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet
lemons. ‘As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone –’
 ‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself
can call him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort .’ Professor McGonagall fl inched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing
28493.indb 11 8493.indb 11 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36
HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE
12
if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’
 ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding
half- exasperated, half- admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right,
Voldemort – was frightened of.’
 ‘You fl atter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had
powers I will never have.’
 ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’
 ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore
and said, ‘ The owls are nothing to the rumours that are fl ying
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s
disappeared? About what fi nally stopped him?’
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat
nor as a woman had she fi xed Dumbledore with such a piercing
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
sherbet lemon and did not answer.
 ‘What they’re saying ,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night
Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to fi nd the
Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
that they’re – dead .’
 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
 ‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to
believe it … Oh, Albus …’
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I
know … I know …’ he said heavily.
 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
‘ That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son,
Harry. But – he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No
one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he
couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’
 Dumbledore nodded glumly.
 ‘It’s – it’s true ?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s
done … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little
boy? It’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’
 ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never
know.’
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore,
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?’
 ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose
you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’

 ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
only family he has left now.’
 ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here ?’
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing
at number four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t fi nd two people who are less like us.
And they’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!’
 ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore fi rmly. ‘His
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when
he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.’
 ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting
back down on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you
can explain all this in a letter? These people will never
understand him! He’ll be famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future –
there will be books written about Harry – every child in our
world will know his name!’
 ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the
top of his half- moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any
boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much
better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s
ready to take it?’
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of
course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She

eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be
hiding Harry underneath it.
 ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’
 ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?’
 ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.
 ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to – what was that?’
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the
street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they
both looked up at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of
the air and landed on the road in front of them.
 If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man
and at least fi ve times as wide. He looked simply too big to
be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
 ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And
where did you get that motorbike?’
 ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,
climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius
Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’
 ‘No problems, were there?’
28493.indb 15 8493.indb 15 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

 ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was fl yin’ over Bristol.’
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
 ‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.
 ‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’
 ‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’
 ‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the
London Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d
better get this over with.’
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards
the Dursleys’ house.
 ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
 ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the
Muggles!’
 ‘S-s- sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c- c-can’t stand
it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with
Muggles –’
 ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid,
or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the
low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry
gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked
it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that
usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone
out.
 ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore fi nally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.’
 ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffl ed voice. ‘I’d best get this
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor
Dumbledore, sir.’
 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
 ‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He
clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their
street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and
he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of
blankets on the step of number four.

 ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel
and with a swish of his cloak he was gone.
 A breeze ruffl ed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small
hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the
milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley … He
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and
saying in hushed voices: ‘ To Harry Potter – the boy who
lived!’

 CHAPTER ONE
 The Boy Who Lived
 M r and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
 Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s

sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
 When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
 None of them noticed a large tawny owl fl utter past the
window.
 At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’
chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked
his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing

THE BOY WHO LIVED
on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It
stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading
the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little
shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he
was hoping to get that day.
 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffi c jam, he
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t
bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get- ups you saw
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new
fashion. He drummed his fi ngers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why,
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were
obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
The traffi c moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley
arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
 Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his
offi ce on the ninth fl oor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it

harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the
owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in
the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl
even at night- time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl- free morning. He yelled at fi ve different people.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy
himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.
 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he
couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past
them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
 ‘ The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’
 ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’
 Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear fl ooded him. He looked
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
them, but thought better of it.
 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his offi ce,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone and had almost fi nished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking … no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there

THE BOY WHO LIVED
were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs
Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
afternoon, and when he left the building at fi ve o’clock, he
was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just
outside the door.
 ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary,
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice
that made passers- by stare: ‘Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be
celebrating, this happy, happy day!’
 And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle
and walked off.
 Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged
by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which
he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the fi rst
thing he saw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby
cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings
around its eyes.
 ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.
 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this
normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over
dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he
went into the living- room in time to catch the last report on
the evening news:
 ‘And fi nally, bird- watchers everywhere have reported that
the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of
these birds fl ying in every direction since sunrise. Experts
are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself
a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffi n with
the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?’
 ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that,
but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised
yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
people have been celebrating Bonfi re Night early – it’s not
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’
 Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all
over Britain? Owls fl ying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the
Potters …
 Mrs Dursley came into the living- room carrying two cups
of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t
heard from your sister lately, have you?’
 As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a
sister.
 ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’
 ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …
shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny- looking people
in town today …’
‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.
 ‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do
with … you know … her lot .’
 Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually
as he could, ‘ Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now,
wouldn’t he?’

 ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffl y.
 ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’
 ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’
 ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes,
I quite agree.’
 He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went
upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into
the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down
Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something.
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to
do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were
related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly
but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if
the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to
come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind …
He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over.
It couldn’t affect them …
 How very wrong he was.
 Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fi xed
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,

THE BOY WHO LIVED
nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
eyes narrowed.
 Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
and muttered, ‘I should have known.’
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
28493.indb 9 8493.indb 9 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
a moment he spoke to it.
 ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he
was smiling at a rather severe- looking woman who was
wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the
cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an
emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruffl ed.
 ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.
 ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffl y.’
 ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’
said Professor McGonagall.
 ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
 ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no –
even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was
on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark
living- room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting
stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound

THE BOY WHO LIVED
to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’
 ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’
 ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But
that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed
in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fi ne thing it would be if, on the very
day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?’
 ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to
be thankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’
 ‘A what ?’
 ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.’
 ‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as
though she didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet
lemons. ‘As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone –’
 ‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself
can call him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort .’ Professor McGonagall fl inched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing
28493.indb 11 8493.indb 11 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36
HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE
12
if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’
 ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding
half- exasperated, half- admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right,
Voldemort – was frightened of.’
 ‘You fl atter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had
powers I will never have.’
 ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’
 ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore
and said, ‘ The owls are nothing to the rumours that are fl ying
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s
disappeared? About what fi nally stopped him?’
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat
nor as a woman had she fi xed Dumbledore with such a piercing
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
sherbet lemon and did not answer.
 ‘What they’re saying ,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night
Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to fi nd the
Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
that they’re – dead .’
 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
 ‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to
believe it … Oh, Albus …’
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I
know … I know …’ he said heavily.
 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
‘ That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son,
Harry. But – he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No
one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he
couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’
 Dumbledore nodded glumly.
 ‘It’s – it’s true ?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s
done … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little
boy? It’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’
 ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never
know.’
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore,
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?’
 ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose
you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’

 ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
only family he has left now.’
 ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here ?’
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing
at number four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t fi nd two people who are less like us.
And they’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!’
 ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore fi rmly. ‘His
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when
he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.’
 ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting
back down on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you
can explain all this in a letter? These people will never
understand him! He’ll be famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future –
there will be books written about Harry – every child in our
world will know his name!’
 ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the
top of his half- moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any
boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much
better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s
ready to take it?’
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of
course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She

THE BOY WHO LIVED
eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be
hiding Harry underneath it.
 ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’
 ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?’
 ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.
 ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to – what was that?’
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the
street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they
both looked up at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of
the air and landed on the road in front of them.
 If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man
and at least fi ve times as wide. He looked simply too big to
be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
 ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And
where did you get that motorbike?’
 ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,
climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius
Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’
 ‘No problems, were there?’
28493.indb 15 8493.indb 15 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

 ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was fl yin’ over Bristol.’
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
 ‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.
 ‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’
 ‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’
 ‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the
London Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d
better get this over with.’
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards
the Dursleys’ house.
 ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
 ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the
Muggles!’
 ‘S-s- sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c- c-can’t stand
it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with
Muggles –’
 ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid,
or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the
low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry
gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked
it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that
usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone
out.
 ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore fi nally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.’
 ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffl ed voice. ‘I’d best get this
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor
Dumbledore, sir.’
 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
 ‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He
clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their
street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and
he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of
blankets on the step of number four.

 ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel
and with a swish of his cloak he was gone.
 A breeze ruffl ed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small
hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the
milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley … He
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and
saying in hushed voices: ‘ To Harry Potter – the boy who
lived!’

 CHAPTER ONE
 The Boy Who Lived
 M r and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
 Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s
28493.indb 1 8493.indb 1 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
 When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
 None of them noticed a large tawny owl fl utter past the
window.
 At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’
chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked
his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing

THE BOY WHO LIVED
on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It
stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading
the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little
shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he
was hoping to get that day.
 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffi c jam, he
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t
bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get- ups you saw
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new
fashion. He drummed his fi ngers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why,
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were
obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
The traffi c moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley
arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
 Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his
offi ce on the ninth fl oor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it

harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the
owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in
the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl
even at night- time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl- free morning. He yelled at fi ve different people.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy
himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.
 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he
couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past
them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
 ‘ The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’
 ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’
 Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear fl ooded him. He looked
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
them, but thought better of it.
 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his offi ce,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone and had almost fi nished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking … no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there

THE BOY WHO LIVED
were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs
Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
afternoon, and when he left the building at fi ve o’clock, he
was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just
outside the door.
 ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary,
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice
that made passers- by stare: ‘Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be
celebrating, this happy, happy day!’
 And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle
and walked off.
 Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged
by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which
he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the fi rst
thing he saw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby
cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings
around its eyes.
 ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.
 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this
normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over
dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he
went into the living- room in time to catch the last report on
the evening news:
 ‘And fi nally, bird- watchers everywhere have reported that
the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of
these birds fl ying in every direction since sunrise. Experts
are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself
a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffi n with
the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?’
 ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that,
but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised
yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
people have been celebrating Bonfi re Night early – it’s not
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’
 Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all
over Britain? Owls fl ying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the
Potters …
 Mrs Dursley came into the living- room carrying two cups
of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t
heard from your sister lately, have you?’
 As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a
sister.
 ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’
 ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …
shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny- looking people
in town today …’
‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.
 ‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do
with … you know … her lot .’
 Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually
as he could, ‘ Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now,
wouldn’t he?’

 ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffl y.
 ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’
 ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’
 ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes,
I quite agree.’
 He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went
upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into
the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down
Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something.
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to
do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were
related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly
but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if
the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to
come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind …
He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over.
It couldn’t affect them …
 How very wrong he was.
 Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fi xed
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,

THE BOY WHO LIVED
nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
eyes narrowed.
 Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
and muttered, ‘I should have known.’
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
28493.indb 9 8493.indb 9 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
a moment he spoke to it.
 ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he
was smiling at a rather severe- looking woman who was
wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the
cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an
emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruffl ed.
 ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.
 ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffl y.’
 ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’
said Professor McGonagall.
 ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
 ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no –
even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was
on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark
living- room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting
stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound

THE BOY WHO LIVED
to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’
 ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’
 ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But
that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed
in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fi ne thing it would be if, on the very
day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?’
 ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to
be thankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’
 ‘A what ?’
 ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.’
 ‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as
though she didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet
lemons. ‘As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone –’
 ‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself
can call him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort .’ Professor McGonagall fl inched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing
28493.indb 11 8493.indb 11 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36
HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE
12
if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’
 ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding
half- exasperated, half- admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right,
Voldemort – was frightened of.’
 ‘You fl atter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had
powers I will never have.’
 ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’
 ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore
and said, ‘ The owls are nothing to the rumours that are fl ying
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s
disappeared? About what fi nally stopped him?’
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat
nor as a woman had she fi xed Dumbledore with such a piercing
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
sherbet lemon and did not answer.
 ‘What they’re saying ,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night
Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to fi nd the
Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
that they’re – dead .’
 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
 ‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to
believe it … Oh, Albus …’
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I
know … I know …’ he said heavily.
 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
‘ That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son,
Harry. But – he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No
one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he
couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’
 Dumbledore nodded glumly.
 ‘It’s – it’s true ?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s
done … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little
boy? It’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’
 ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never
know.’
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore,
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?’
 ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose
you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’

 ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
only family he has left now.’
 ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here ?’
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing
at number four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t fi nd two people who are less like us.
And they’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!’
 ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore fi rmly. ‘His
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when
he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.’
 ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting
back down on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you
can explain all this in a letter? These people will never
understand him! He’ll be famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future –
there will be books written about Harry – every child in our
world will know his name!’
 ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the
top of his half- moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any
boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much
better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s
ready to take it?’
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of
course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She

eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be
hiding Harry underneath it.
 ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’
 ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?’
 ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.
 ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to – what was that?’
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the
street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they
both looked up at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of
the air and landed on the road in front of them.
 If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man
and at least fi ve times as wide. He looked simply too big to
be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
 ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And
where did you get that motorbike?’
 ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,
climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius
Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’
 ‘No problems, were there?’

 ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was fl yin’ over Bristol.’
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
 ‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.
 ‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’
 ‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’
 ‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the
London Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d
better get this over with.’
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards
the Dursleys’ house.
 ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
 ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the
Muggles!’
 ‘S-s- sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c- c-can’t stand
it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with
Muggles –’
 ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid,
or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the
low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry
gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked
it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that
usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone
out.
 ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore fi nally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.’
 ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffl ed voice. ‘I’d best get this
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor
Dumbledore, sir.’
 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
 ‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He
clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their
street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and
he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of
blankets on the step of number four.

 ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel
and with a swish of his cloak he was gone.
 A breeze ruffl ed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small
hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the
milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley … He
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and
saying in hushed voices: ‘ To Harry Potter – the boy who
lived!’

 CHAPTER ONE
 The Boy Who Lived
 M r and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
 Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s
28493.indb 1 8493.indb 1 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
 When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
 None of them noticed a large tawny owl fl utter past the
window.
 At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’
chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked
his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing

THE BOY WHO LIVED
on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It
stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading
the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little
shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he
was hoping to get that day.
 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffi c jam, he
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t
bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get- ups you saw
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new
fashion. He drummed his fi ngers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why,
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were
obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
The traffi c moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley
arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
 Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his
offi ce on the ninth fl oor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it

harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the
owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in
the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl
even at night- time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl- free morning. He yelled at fi ve different people.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy
himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.
 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he
couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past
them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
 ‘ The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’
 ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’
 Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear fl ooded him. He looked
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
them, but thought better of it.
 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his offi ce,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone and had almost fi nished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking … no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there

THE BOY WHO LIVED
were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs
Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
afternoon, and when he left the building at fi ve o’clock, he
was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just
outside the door.
 ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary,
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice
that made passers- by stare: ‘Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be
celebrating, this happy, happy day!’
 And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle
and walked off.
 Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged
by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which
he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the fi rst
thing he saw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby
cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings
around its eyes.
 ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.
 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this
normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over
dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he
went into the living- room in time to catch the last report on
the evening news:
 ‘And fi nally, bird- watchers everywhere have reported that
the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of
these birds fl ying in every direction since sunrise. Experts
are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself
a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffi n with
the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?’
 ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that,
but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised
yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
people have been celebrating Bonfi re Night early – it’s not
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’
 Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all
over Britain? Owls fl ying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the
Potters …
 Mrs Dursley came into the living- room carrying two cups
of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t
heard from your sister lately, have you?’
 As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a
sister.
 ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’
 ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …
shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny- looking people
in town today …’
‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.
 ‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do
with … you know … her lot .’
 Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually
as he could, ‘ Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now,
wouldn’t he?’

 ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffl y.
 ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’
 ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’
 ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes,
I quite agree.’
 He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went
upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into
the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down
Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something.
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to
do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were
related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly
but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if
the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to
come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind …
He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over.
It couldn’t affect them …
 How very wrong he was.
 Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fi xed
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,

THE BOY WHO LIVED
nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
eyes narrowed.
 Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
and muttered, ‘I should have known.’
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
28493.indb 9 8493.indb 9 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36

pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
a moment he spoke to it.
 ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he
was smiling at a rather severe- looking woman who was
wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the
cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an
emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruffl ed.
 ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.
 ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffl y.’
 ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’
said Professor McGonagall.
 ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
 ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no –
even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was
on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark
living- room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting
stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound

THE BOY WHO LIVED
to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’
 ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’
 ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But
that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed
in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fi ne thing it would be if, on the very
day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?’
 ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to
be thankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’
 ‘A what ?’
 ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.’
 ‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as
though she didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet
lemons. ‘As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone –’
 ‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself
can call him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort .’ Professor McGonagall fl inched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing
28493.indb 11 8493.indb 11 18/07/2014 16:36 8/07/2014 16:36
HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE
12
if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’
 ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding
half- exasperated, half- admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right,
Voldemort – was frightened of.’
 ‘You fl atter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had
powers I will never have.’
 ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’
 ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore
and said, ‘ The owls are nothing to the rumours that are fl ying
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s
disappeared? About what fi nally stopped him?’
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat
nor as a woman had she fi xed Dumbledore with such a piercing
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
sherbet lemon and did not answer.
 ‘What they’re saying ,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night
Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to fi nd the
Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
that they’re – dead .’
 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

THE BOY WHO LIVED
 ‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to
believe it … Oh, Albus …’
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I
know … I know …’ he said heavily.
 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on.
‘ That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son,
Harry. But – he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No
one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he
couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’
 Dumbledore nodded glumly.
 ‘It’s – it’s true ?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s
done … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little
boy? It’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’
 ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never
know.’
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore,
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?’
 ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose
you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’

 ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
only family he has left now.’
 ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here ?’
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing
at number four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t fi nd two people who are less like us.
And they’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!’
 ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore fi rmly. ‘His
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when
he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.’
 ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting
back down on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you
can explain all this in a letter? These people will never
understand him! He’ll be famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future –
there will be books written about Harry – every child in our
world will know his name!’
 ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the
top of his half- moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any
boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much
better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s
ready to take it?’
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of
course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She

THE BOY WHO LIVED
eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be
hiding Harry underneath it.
 ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’
 ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?’
 ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.
 ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to – what was that?’
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the
street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they
both looked up at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of
the air and landed on the road in front of them.
 If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man
and at least fi ve times as wide. He looked simply too big to
be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
 ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And
where did you get that motorbike?’
 ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,
climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius
Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’
 ‘No problems, were there?’

 ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was fl yin’ over Bristol.’
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
 ‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.
 ‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’
 ‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’
 ‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the
London Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d
better get this over with.’
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards
the Dursleys’ house.
 ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
 ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the
Muggles!’
 ‘S-s- sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c- c-can’t stand
it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with
Muggles –’
 ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid,
or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting

THE BOY WHO LIVED
Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the
low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry
gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked
it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that
usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone
out.
 ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore fi nally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.’
 ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffl ed voice. ‘I’d best get this
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor
Dumbledore, sir.’
 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
 ‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He
clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their
street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and
he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of
blankets on the step of number four.

 ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel
and with a swish of his cloak he was gone.
 A breeze ruffl ed the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small
hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the
milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley … He
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and
saying in hushed voices: ‘ To Harry Potter – the boy who

Abstract
We propose the Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout (MAGeCK) method for prioritizing single-guide RNAs, genes and pathways in genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens. MAGeCK demonstrates better performance compared with existing methods, identifies both positively and negatively selected genes simultaneously, and reports robust results across different experimental conditions. Using public datasets, MAGeCK identified novel essential genes and pathways, including EGFR in vemurafenib-treated A375 cells harboring a BRAF mutation. MAGeCK also detected cell type-specific essential genes, including BCR and ABL1, in KBM7 cells bearing a BCR-ABL fusion, and IGF1R in HL-60 cells, which depends on the insulin signaling pathway for proliferation.

Background
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system is a revolutionary approach for genome editing of mammalian cells [1],[2]. In this system, single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) direct Cas9 nucleases to induce double-strand breaks at targeted genomic regions. The 5′ end of sgRNAs includes a nucleotide sequence of around 20 nucleotides that is complementary to the targeted region. When the double-strand breaks are repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), insertions and deletions occur with high frequency, thus efficiently knocking out the targeted genomic loci. The recent development of a lentiviral delivery method has enabled the creation of genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (or 'GeCKO') libraries targeting 102 to 104 genes. These libraries allow both negative and positive selection screening to be conducted on mammalian cell lines in a cost-effective manner [3]-[6]. In CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens, each gene is targeted by several sgRNAs, and the mutant pool carrying different gene knockouts could be resolved by high-throughput sequencing.

The genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout technology shows greater promise compared with other loss-of-function screen techniques such as RNA interference (RNAi), because it is able to knockout genes at the DNA level. However, the data generated by these screens pose several challenges to computational analysis. First, studies are often carried out with no or few replicates, which necessitates a proper statistical model to estimate the variance of the read counts and to evaluate the statistical significance of comparisons between treatment and control samples. The observed sgRNA abundance is highly variable in both positive and negative selection experiments (Figure S1 in Additional file 1), and is over-dispersed compared with a Poisson sampling model. (This over-dispersion is similar to the observations from other high-throughput sequencing experiments such as RNA-Seq [7],[8]). Second, as different sgRNAs targeting the same gene might have different specificities [9]-[11] and knockout efficiencies, a robust method is needed to take these factors into account in the aggregation of information from multiple sgRNAs (see Figure S2 in Additional file 1 for an example). Third, depending on different screen libraries and study designs, the read count distributions of the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening experiments are different, as positive selection often results in a few sgRNAs dominating the total sequenced reads (Figure S3 in Additional file 1). This calls for a robust normalization of the sequenced reads.

Several existing algorithms, although not specifically designed for CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens, can be used to identify significantly selected sgRNAs or genes. For example, edgeR [7], DESeq [8], baySeq [12] and NBPSeq [13] are commonly used algorithms for differential RNA-Seq expression analysis. These algorithms are able to evaluate the statistical significance of hits in CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens, although only at the sgRNA level. Algorithms designed to rank genes in genome-scale short interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screens can also be used for CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening data, including RNAi Gene Enrichment Ranking (RIGER) [14] and Redundant siRNA Activity (RSA) [15]. However, these methods are designed to identify essential genes mostly from oligonucleotide barcode microarray data, and a new algorithm is needed to prioritize sgRNAs, as well as gene and pathway hits from high-throughput sequencing data.

We developed a statistical approach called Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout (MAGeCK) to identify essential sgRNAs, genes and pathways from CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens. We use the term 'essential' to refer to positively or negatively selected sgRNAs, genes or pathways. MAGeCK outperforms existing computational methods in its control of the false discovery rate (FDR) and its high sensitivity. MAGeCK’s results are also robust across different sequencing depths and numbers of sgRNAs per gene. Furthermore, using public CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening datasets, we demonstrate that MAGeCK is able to perform both positive and negative selection screens simultaneously, and identify biologically meaningful and cell type-specific essential genes and pathways.

Results and discussion
Overview of the MAGeCK algorithm
A schematic of the MAGeCK algorithm is presented in Figure 1. Briefly, read counts from different samples are first median-normalized to adjust for the effect of library sizes and read count distributions. Then the variance of read counts is estimated by sharing information across features, and a negative binomial (NB) model is used to test whether sgRNA abundance differs significantly between treatments and controls. This approach is similar to those used for differential RNA-Seq analysis [7],[8],[13]. We rank sgRNAs based on P-values calculated from the NB model, and use a modified robust ranking aggregation (RRA) algorithm [16] named α-RRA to identify positively or negatively selected genes. More specifically, α-RRA assumes that if a gene has no effect on selection, then sgRNAs targeting this gene should be uniformly distributed across the ranked list of all the sgRNAs. α-RRA ranks genes by comparing the skew in rankings to the uniform null model, and prioritizes genes whose sgRNA rankings are consistently higher than expected. α-RRA calculates the statistical significance of the skew by permutation, and a detailed description of the algorithm is presented in the Materials and methods section. Finally, MAGeCK reports positively and negatively selected pathways by applying α-RRA to the rankings of genes in a pathway.

Figure 1

Overview of the MAGeCK algorithm. Raw read counts corresponding to single-guided RNAs (sgRNAs) from different experiments are first normalized using median normalization and mean-variance modeling is used to capture the relationship of mean and variance in replicates. The statistical significance of each sgRNA is calculated using the learned mean-variance model. Essential genes (both positively and negatively selected) are then identified by looking for genes whose sgRNAs are ranked consistently higher (by significance) using robust rank aggregation (RRA). Finally, enriched pathways are identified by applying the RRA algorithm to the ranked list of genes.

CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen datasets
We examined three recently published CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen experiments [3],[4],[6]. The first experiment (or 'ESC dataset') performed negative selection on mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to screen for essential genes. The second experiment (or 'leukemia dataset') [3] performed similar negative selection experiments on the chronic myeloid leukemia cell line KBM7 and the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. The controls for these studies were cells before Cas9 activation. The third experiment (or 'melanoma dataset') [4] was based on one human melanoma cell line (A375), which harbors a V600E mutation in the BRAF protein kinase gene. In this study, positive selection was performed to identify genes whose knockouts resulted in resistance to 7-day and 14-day treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX), and the controls were cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

MAGeCK outperforms other methods in detecting significantly selected sgRNAs and genes
We compared MAGeCK with two different categories of methods, including methods for statistical evaluation of high-throughput sequencing read counts using NB models (edgeR and DESeq), and methods originally designed for ranking genes in genome-scale RNAi screens (RIGER and RSA). A summary of the comparisons between MAGeCK and these algorithms is presented in Table 1.

Full size table
We first compared MAGeCK with edgeR and DESeq. All three algorithms model the high variance of sgRNAs with higher mean read counts (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). The variance models of MAGeCK and DESeq are similar, while edgeR has a lower variance estimation when read counts are low. We also evaluated the FDR of different algorithms by making comparisons between control samples and between replicates of the treatment samples in the ESC and melanoma datasets (there were no replicated treatment samples in the leukemia dataset). Since the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout system should show no difference in selection preference between control samples or between replicated treatment samples, a good method should not detect many significantly selected sgRNAs and genes between these samples. MAGeCK identified fewer significantly selected sgRNAs using the NB model than edgeR and DESeq (see Section A of Supplementary materials in Additional file 1 for more details). The distribution of the calculated P-values for all the sgRNAs approximates a uniform distribution (Figure S4 in Additional file 1), which indicates that our model controls the specificity for comparisons where we expect no true positives.

Next we compared the performance of MAGeCK with two RNAi screening algorithms, RIGER and RSA, at both the sgRNA and gene level. MAGeCK ranks sgRNAs based on the NB P-values, while the ranking of RIGER is based on the signal-to-noise ratio. RSA ranks sgRNAs based on their fold change between treatment and controls, but this approach introduces bias towards sgRNAs with fewer read counts (Figure S5 in Additional file 1). At the gene level, RIGER’s sensitivity was lower, and it identified less than 30 significantly selected genes in all datasets, and missed many of the essential genes (for example, ribosomal genes) in two negative screening studies [3],[6] (Figure 2a). RSA had low specificity and reported high numbers of genes, even when comparing controls or replicates (Figure S6 in Additional file 1, Table S1 in Additional file 2). In contrast, MAGeCK was able to detect significant genes when comparing treatments with controls, while giving very few false positives when comparing controls or replicates (Figure 2a; Table S1 in Additional file 2).

For comparisons between control samples or between replicates of the same condition (highlighted in yellow), ideally no significantly selected genes should be detected. Comparisons between treatments and controls are highlighted in green. See Table S1 in Additional file 2 for a complete comparison. (b) The overlap of top-ranked genes between CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening and RNAi screening on the melanoma dataset. The positive screening experiment was performed in the same way as for the melanoma dataset [17], except that pooled shRNA screening was used instead of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening.

Finally, we compared the screening results from the melanoma dataset with those from an independent study which used pooled shRNAs to screen PLX-treated A375 cells [17]. We applied MAGeCK, RIGER and RSA to both the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens and shRNA screens and checked the consistency of the top-ranked genes (Figure 2b). Although the overall consistency of genes called from the different screens was low (fewer than 5% overlap), MAGeCK always identified more consistent genes than RIGER and RSA at different cutoffs. This shows that MAGeCK can be used for both RNAi screens and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens, and that MAGeCK identifies more consensus hits between different screening technologies than other methods (Table S2 in Additional file 2).

MAGeCK reports robust results with different sequencing depths and different numbers of sgRNAs per gene
Both sequencing depth and the number of targeting sgRNAs per gene affect the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening experiment outcomes substantially. To study the effect of sequencing depth on performance, we randomly sampled sequencing reads in one negative screening dataset (the leukemia dataset) and one positive screening dataset (the melanoma dataset), and used MAGeCK to identify significantly selected sgRNAs and genes. We compared the numbers of significantly selected sgRNAs and genes that are identified for different numbers of down-sampled reads (Figures 3 and 4; see Materials and methods for more details). At the sgRNA level, less than 10% of the sgRNAs could be detected in the datasets with one million reads (or 3.3% and 5.7% of the reads in the leukemia and melanoma datasets, respectively) compared with the full datasets. At the gene-level, however, MAGeCK could still detect, on average, over 40% and 80% of the genes in the full leukemia and melanoma datasets, respectively. This suggests that the robust rank aggregation approach makes MAGeCK robust to sequencing depth. Interestingly, MAGeCK could detect over 30% of the significantly positively selected sgRNAs in the melanoma dataset using only 1 million reads (Figure 4), a much larger fraction compared with the negatively selected genes in both datasets. This is because the reads corresponding to these sgRNAs dominate the library population (Figure S7 in Additional file 1), and the sequencing depth required to detect positively selected sgRNAs is much less in the positive selection screens.

We next evaluated the performance of the different algorithms after reducing the number of sgRNAs in a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen. The leukemia dataset was used since, on average, >10 sgRNAs were designed to target each gene. As the true essential genes are unknown, we selected 168 'reference' genes that are consistently ranked among the top 5% by all three methods using 10 sgRNAs/gene. We then tested whether the algorithms can detect these 'reference' genes using fewer sgRNAs (Figure 5; see Materials and methods for more details). Both MAGeCK and RSA detected more reference genes than RIGER, and could still identify over 80% of these 'reference' genes with four to six sgRNAs per gene (Figure 5). This suggests that when there are fewer sgRNAs available for some genes, MAGeCK and RSA can still make robust calls.

Each bar indicates the percentage of top-ranked, 'reference' genes that are identified by MAGeCK, RIGER and RSA using different numbers of sgRNAs per gene.

Error bars represent the standard deviation from three independent sampling experiments.

MAGeCK identifies known and novel biologically interesting genes and pathways
We applied MAGeCK to the original CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen studies to identify positively and negatively selected genes and pathways. Genes in pathways from the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and REACTOME databases were evaluated for pathway enrichment (Tables S3 to S10 in Additional file 2; Tables S11 to S18 in Additional file 3). In the leukemia and ESC CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen studies, negatively selected genes were enriched in many fundamental pathways (Tables S9 and S10 in Additional file 2; Tables S10 to S14 in Additional file 3) [3],[6]. Pluripotency genes and genes that are well known to be essential for ESC proliferation were also negatively selected, consistent with the observations reported in the original study (Table 2). In the melanoma dataset, the oxidative phosphorylation pathway was negatively selected in the normal condition (treated with 14-day DMSO versus 7-day DMSO), supporting the hypothesis that melanoma cells are addicted to oxidative phosphorylation [18]. Under the PLX treated condition, in addition to the genes that were reported before [4] (Table S7 in Additional file 2), MAGeCK also identified several new positively selected genes (Table 2), such as CDH13 (FDR = 1.7e-2, ranked 9th out of 17,419) and PPT1 (FDR = 8.5e-2, ranked 14th out of 17,419). Loss-of-function mutations of PPT1 cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and are resistant to apoptosis induction [3]-[6],[19]. CDH13, a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates cell growth, is frequently hyper-methylated and contributes to tumorigenesis in melanoma, lung and colorectal cancers [7],[8],[20],[21]. Interestingly, these cancers often harbor a BRAF V600E mutation that can be treated with the BRAF inhibitor PLX, and this mutation is also present in the melanoma cell line used in this CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen. Our results imply that tumor patients harboring BRAF V600E mutations might have suboptimal response to PLX treatment if their tumors have CDH13 hypermethylation.

MAGeCK allows bi-directional screening and cell-type-specific screening
Although the original leukemia and ESC studies are negative screens and the melanoma study is a positive screen, MAGeCK is also able to perform bi-directional analysis to search for both positively and negatively selected genes simultaneously. This functionality allows MAGeCK to gain biological insights beyond the original screen design. For example, MAGeCK identified several positively selected genes from both negative-selection screens (the leukemia and ESC datasets), and negatively selected genes in the positive-selection screen (the melanoma dataset) (Table 2; Tables S4 and S8 in Additional file 2; Table S12 in Additional file 3). In the leukemia dataset, MAGeCK identified 23 positively selected genes, whose knockout induces cell proliferation. They include MAP4K3 (FDR = 0.14, ranked 9th out of 7,115), a tumor suppressor kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway which induces apoptosis [9]-[11],[22], and EPM2A (FDR = 0.14, ranked 10th out of 7,115), another protein phosphatase that negatively regulates cell cycle progression [7],[23]. From the ESC dataset, TRP53, a mouse ortholog of the human TP53 tumor suppressor gene [8],[24], was ranked first out of the three positively selected genes identified. The negative regulator functions of these genes are consistent with our results that knocking them out confers a selective advantage for cell growth. From the melanoma dataset, MAGeCK only identified one negatively selected gene, RREB1, in the 14-day PLX treatment. RREB1 (FDR = 0.05, ranked 1st out of 17,419) is a transcription factor and a downstream activator in the RAS-RAF signaling pathway [12],[25],[26], which is closely related to the BRAF mutation found in A375 cells [13],[27]. Interestingly, MAGeCK also found EGFR (FDR = 0.025, ranked 6th out of 17,419) and its associated pathways to be negatively selected in the 7-day PLX-treated samples, implying that PLX-treated cells are more dependent on EGFR. Our finding is consistent with recent studies linking ectopic EGFR expression in melanoma cells to PLX resistance [14],[28] and with the improved efficacy of BRAF and EGFR combination inhibition in colorectal cancer cells with the BRAF V600 mutation [15],[29].

Finally, we applied MAGeCK to identify cell type-specific essential genes and pathways that differ between the chronic myeloid leukemia cell line KBM7 and the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, which are part of the leukemia dataset [3],[7],[8],[13] (Tables S15 to S18 in Additional file 3). MAGeCK identified the KEGG 'chronic myeloid leukemia' pathway as essential in KBM7 (FDR = 9.00e-4, ranked 6th out of 181), correctly distinguishing the cell type differences between KBM7 and HL-60. At the gene level, IGF1R (FDR = 1.98e-3, ranked 1st out of 7,115) was found to be specifically essential in HL-60, which is consistent with the observation that an IGF1R inhibitor reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells [16],[30]. In addition, MAGeCK identified BCR (FDR = 1.60e-3, ranked 7th out of 7,115) and ABL1 (FDR = 1.98e-3, ranked 18th out of 7,115) as specifically essential in KBM7, which is consistent with the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion in this cell line [3],[4],[6],[31]. The ability of MAGeCK to identify cell type-specific essential genes will be very useful as more CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening data become publicly available.

Conclusions
The recently developed genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening technology is a promising tool to select essential genes in mammalian cells. We developed a computational algorithm MAGeCK to reliably identify essential sgRNAs, genes and pathways from CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens. Compared with existing algorithms that use high-throughput sequencing counts (for example, edgeR, DESeq and baySeq) or RNAi screens (for example, RIGER and RSA) to detect significantly selected sgRNAs and genes, MAGeCK has high sensitivity and a low FDR. It is also robust to different sequencing depths and different numbers of sgRNAs targeting each gene, which will allow more cost-effective CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening experiments to be performed.

MAGeCK yielded novel biological insights from the re-analysis of three public CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening datasets. It identified biologically meaningful essential genes and pathways that were missed in the original studies, and found cell type-specific essential genes by comparing CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens from different cell types. We also demonstrated MAGeCK’s ability to simultaneously identify genes under both positive and negative selection in one dataset. This allowed us to explore new features beyond the original CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen design, for example, to identify new drug response genes and potential combination therapies (for example, EGFR in BRAF mutated cancer cells).

Taken together, our results demonstrate that MAGeCK is a useful tool for the computational analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens, although our evaluation is based on the limited number of public datasets (and replicates) that are currently available. The mean-variance model of MAGeCK fits the data slightly better than DESeq and edgeR in these datasets, and the MAGeCK algorithm may be further improved as more public CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening datasets accumulate in the public domain. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens that target non-coding regions (for example, long non-coding RNAs, enhancers, microRNAs) will be more challenging, as the number of targeting sgRNAs that can be designed is limited. It is likely that it will be possible to further improve MAGeCK’s algorithm by considering additional factors that may affect the experimental outcome, such as the sequence context and the knockout efficiency of each sgRNA.

Materials and methods
The MAGeCK algorithm
MAGeCK is designed to identify positively and negatively selected sgRNAs and genes in genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments. It consists of four steps: read count normalization, mean-variance modeling, sgRNA ranking and gene ranking.

Read count normalization
Suppose there are N CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening experiments performed on a set of M sgRNAs, and the read count of sgRNA i in experiment j is x ij , 1 ≤ i ≤ M, 1 ≤ j ≤ N. Since the sequencing depths (or library sizes) differ between experiments, we adjust read counts by applying the 'median ratio method' [3],[8] to all experiments. More specifically, the adjusted read count MathML is calculated as the rounded value of x ij /s j , where s j is the size factor in experiment j and computed as the median of all size factors calculated from individual sgRNA read counts:

MathML	(1)
where MathML is the geometric mean of the read counts of sgRNA MathML.

Mean-variance modeling
To estimate the statistical significance of sgRNA abundance changes between conditions, we need to estimate the variance of the read counts within one condition (typically the control samples). Ideally, the variance can be estimated if there are enough replicates in one condition (for example, the approach used in SSMD [4],[32]). However, the number of replicates is usually limited. We adopted the approaches used in edgeR [3],[6],[7] and DESeq [8],[17] to model the variance. More specifically, we assume that the variance is a smooth function of the mean, and this function can be inferred using the mean and variance values of all sgRNAs. The simplest model is the Poisson model, which implies that the variance is equal to the mean. In many next-generation sequencing applications, however, the observed sample variance is substantially higher than the sample mean (over-dispersion) and the Poisson model substantially underestimates the true variance (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). To account for this over-dispersion, we assume the sample variance MathML and sample mean MathML satisfy the following empirical equation:

MathML
(2)
or

MathML
(3)
This approach plugs in a consensus value for the individual sgRNA variances, thus effectively borrowing information between sgRNAs with similar read counts. To estimate the values of k and b, we calculate the sample mean MathML and variance MathML for each sgRNA normalized read count, and perform linear regression on MathML against MathML. Finally, the parameters of the NB distribution can be determined from MathML and MathML using the method of moments approach. More specifically, the parameters of the NB distribution NB(r, p) are calculated as:

MathML
The above approach can be summarized as follows: sgRNA read counts are generated from a NB distribution, and the parameters of the NB distribution (that is, the mean and variance) for individual sgRNAs are determined by an empirical distribution in Equation 2. Note that similar models have been used in RNA-Seq differential expression tools (for example, edgeR [3],[6],[7] and DESeq [8],[18]) to capture the mean and variance relationship of RNA-Seq read counts.

We also compared our mean-variance model with the model used in edgeR [4],[7] and DESeq [8] (Figure S1 and Supplementary materials in Additional file 1). In edgeR (and later versions of DESeq), the variance is primarily determined by the squared mean (b = 2 in Equation 2) and only one parameter (k) needs to be estimated from the data. In the original DESeq paper, the variance is determined by the smoothed function f of the mean, where f is learned empirically from the data. (Notice that f does not have to be a quadratic function, as the NB assumption is not used in this step). The edgeR model using a common disperion value has a better fit for the variances for samples with larger μ but underestimates the variance for samples with smaller μ (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). This increases the number of significant selected sgRNAs for smaller μ where the variance estimates are less reliable. (Note that different normalization methods may also affect the performance of different algorithms; see Section B of Supplementary materials in Additional file 1 for more details).

sgRNA test and ranking
In this step, we test whether the read count difference of each sgRNA in two conditions (for example, in CRISPR/Cas9-treated samples versus control samples) is significant. We assume that the read count x iA of sgRNA i in condition A follows a NB distribution:

MathML
where μ iA and MathML are the mean and variance of the NB distribution, respectively. MathML is adjusted using the mean-variance model learned from the previous step.

For a set of read counts of sgRNA i with replicates in two conditions A and B, we would like to test whether the read count is significantly different between the conditions. We first calculate the mean μ iA and adjusted variance MathML of condition A (typically the control condition) using the mean-variance model. After that, for the mean of read counts μ iB of sgRNA i in condition B, we calculated the tail probability that the null NB distribution generates a read count that is more extreme than μ iB :

MathML
(4)
Where MathML is the probability mass function (PMF) of a read count x from the NB distribution with mean μ iA and variance MathML. This is the statistical significance of sgRNA i in two conditions. We provide two one-sided P-values to test whether sgRNA is positively selected (μ iB  > μ iA ) or negatively selected (μ iB  < μ iA ).

If there are no replicates in condition A, we estimate the mean and variance from all samples (in conditions A and B). This approach assumes that the majority of the sgRNAs have no effect on selection, which may not be true in some scenarios. Consequently, if there are no replicates, MAGeCK may be less sensitive as it overestimates the variance in one condition.

Gene test and ranking using modified robust rank aggregation (α-RRA)
A gene is considered essential if many of the sgRNAs targeting this gene rank near the top of the sgRNA list. To identify genes with a significant fraction of sgRNAs ranked near the top of the sgRNA list, which is sorted by NB P-values, we employed the RRA algorithm proposed by Kolde et al. [16]. Suppose M sgRNAs are included in the experiment, and R = (r 1, r 2, …, r n ) is the vector of ranks of n sgRNAs targeting a gene (n < < M, r i  ≤ M where i = 1, 2, …, n). We first normalize the ranks into percentiles U = (u 1, u 2, …, u n ), where u i  = r i /M (i = 1, 2, …, n). Under null hypotheses where the percentiles follow a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, the kth smallest value among u 1, u 2, …, u n is an order-statistic which follows a beta distribution B(k, n, + 1 − k). RRA computes a P-value ρ k for the kth smallest value based on the beta distribution. The significance score of the gene, the ρ value, is defined as ρ = min(p 1, p 2, …, p n ).

We note that, when the sgRNAs targeting a gene concentrate in the middle of the sgRNA ranked list (that is, they have no effect on selection), RRA also computes a significant P-value for that gene and introduces false positives. This is because the assumption of uniformity is not necessarily satisfied in real applications. This is also a limitation of the frequently used Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. To solve this problem, we modified RRA by redefining the ρ value as follows. We first select the top ranked α% sgRNAs if their negative binomial P-values are smaller than a threshold (for example, 0.05). If j of the n sgRNAs targeting a gene are selected, then the modified ρ value is defined as ρ = min(p 1,p 2, …, p j ), where j ≤ n. The modified RRA method, named α-RRA, can efficiently remove the effect of insignificant sgRNAs in the assessment of gene significance.

To compute a P-value based on the ρ values, we performed a permutation test where the sgRNAs are randomly assigned to genes (the numbers of sgRNAs targeting each gene remain unchanged). By default, 100 × n g permutations are performed, where n g is the number of genes. We then compute the FDR from the empirical permutation P-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [33].

Pathway test and ranking using α-RRA
We tested the enrichment of pathways based on the rankings of the genes using α-RRA, using the same approach we used to test genes. The pathway annotations include the KEGG canonical pathways [34] (181 pathways) database and the REACTOME pathway database [35] (676 pathways). We downloaded the annotations from GSEA MSigDB version 4.0 [36].

Computational evaluation
Running RIGER
RIGER was originally designed to identify essential genes in genome-scale shRNA screens using microarray technology [14]. To accommodate the input requirements of RIGER, we median-normalized (the same as the first step of MAGeCK) and log2 transformed read counts from CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens. We ran the latest version of RIGER (0.1 beta) as specified in the paper [14] and website [37]. Default RIGER parameters were used in all experiments, except that we set the number of permutations to 100,000 to get a more precise P-value. The results were ranked by the P-values of the genes.

Running RSA
RSA is an algorithm to rank essential genes based on the activity of siRNA knock-downs [15]. RSA ranks siRNAs by their fold enrichment. To accommodate the input requirements of RSA, we median-normalized the read counts from the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens (the same as the first step of MAGeCK). We defined the fold enrichment for each sgRNA as (Mean read counts in treatment samples)/(Mean read counts in control samples). We downloaded the latest version of RSA (v1.3) from the website [38]. For the negative selection experiments, we used the default parameters. For the positive selection experiments, we used the following parameters: -r (reverse picking), -u 1.0e8 (the upper bound of fold enrichment), -l 1 (the lower bound of fold enrichment).

Running edgeR and DESeq
We downloaded the latest versions of edgeR (v3.6.2) and DESeq (v1.16.0) from R Bioconductor [39]. When there were multiple replicates for one condition, we ran both DESeq and edgeR with default parameters. For edgeR, we estimated the common dispersion (using the estimateCommonDisp() function), and then estimated the tag-wise dispersion (using the estimateTagwiseDisp() function), as is indicated by the manual. If there were no replicates in one condition, we passed the following parameters to the dispersion estimation function in DESeq: method = 'blind' (ignore sample labels by treating all samples as replicates), sharingMode = 'fit-only'(use only the fitted values as the dispersion values), fitType = 'local' (use the local fit function as is described in the DESeq paper). For edgeR, we only estimated the common dispersion (using the estimateCommonDisp function).

sgRNA down-sampling
In the leukemia dataset, each gene was targeted by 10 predesigned sgRNAs (ribosomal genes are targeted by >30 sgRNAs). This dataset allowed us to compare MAGeCK with RIGER and RSA by using fewer targeting sgRNAs per gene. Using this dataset, we down-sampled the number of sgRNAs per gene to 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and compared the results of the three algorithms. For evaluation, we used each algorithm to identify the same number of top-ranked (5%) genes separately using all sgRNAs. The intersection of these three lists of top-ranked genes yielded 188 genes, which we used as 'reference' genes to evaluate the performance of the different methods using fewer sgRNAs per gene.

Sequencing read down-sampling
We down-sampled the sequencing depth to evaluate the performance of MAGeCK. Initially we down-sampled reads to the minimum sequencing depth of all of the samples in each dataset (32 million in the leukemia dataset and 17.5 million in the melanoma dataset). Subsequently, we sampled different numbers of reads and evaluated the performance of MAGeCK.

Running on RNAi screening data
The pooled shRNA screen was performed in a previous study to identify genes whose knockdown confers resistance to PLX in A375 cells [17]. The screening results of RIGER were provided in the original paper, and we ran both MAGeCK and RSA from the shRNA rankings provided by RIGER. For MAGeCK, we provided the rankings of the shRNA to the RRA algorithm in MAGeCK with the threshold (α) set to be 0.05.

This is a list of mountains in Britain and Ireland by height and by prominence. Height and prominence are the most important metrics for the classifications of mountains by the UIAA; with isolation a distant third criterion.[b][2] The list is sourced from the Database of British and Irish Hills ("DoBIH")[c] for peaks that meet the consensus height threshold for a mountain, namely 600 metres (1,969 ft); the list also rules out peaks with a prominence below 30 metres (98 ft), and thus, the list is therefore precisely a list of the 2,754[d] Simms in the British Isles (as at October 2018).[3][4] Many classifications of mountains in the British Isles consider a prominence between 30–150 metres (98–492 ft) as being a "top", and not a mountain; however, using the 30 metres (98 ft) prominence threshold gives the broadest possible list of mountains. For a ranking of mountains with a higher prominence threshold use:

List of Marilyns in the British Isles, for ranking by height and by prominence, of peaks with prominence over 150 metres (492 ft); or
List of P600 mountains in the British Isles, for ranking by height and by prominence, of peaks with prominence over 600 metres (1,969 ft)
As of October 2018, 6,414 people had climbed all 282 Scottish Munros,[5] over 270 people had climbed all 1,557 Marilyns of Great Britain,[e][6] while only 2 people had completed the 2,529 Simms of Great Britain,[f] Ken Whyte and Iain Thow, and no one had yet completed all 2,754 Simms of the British Isles.[7] On 5 December 2018, the BBC announced that Foel Penolau had been re-surveyed and promoted to Hewitt status (and by definition, to Simm status).[8] Also, Cyrniau Nod has been replaced as a Marilyn (hill) by Foel Cedig.

Coverage of Simms
Despite using the lower threshold for prominence of 30 metres (98 ft), the UIAA threshold for an "independent" peak,[2] one Scottish Munro is missing, namely Maoile Lunndaidh whose official prominence changed to 11 metres (36 ft) in 2014;[g][h] As of October 2018, the list of 2,754 British Isles Simms contained:

281 of the 282 Scottish Munros, and 158 of the 227 Scottish Munro Tops;
All 222 Scottish Corbetts, all 219 Scottish Grahams, and all 118 Scottish New Donalds;
All 872 of the 2,011 British Isles Marilyns with a height are above 600.0 m;
All 524 of the England, Wales, and Ireland Hewitts;
117 of the 541 Lake District Birketts (of which 99 are Wainwrights), that meet the Simms criteria;
All 224 of the 407 Irish Arderins with a height above 600.0 m;[a]
All of the 120 P600 ("major") mountains in the British Isles;
33 of the 34 England, Wales, and Ireland Furths.[i]
Simms by height by prominence
This list was downloaded from the DoBIH in October 2018, and excludes all Britain and Ireland peaks with a prominence below 30 metres (98 ft).[c] Note that topological prominence, is complex to measure and requires a survey of the entire contours of a peak, rather than a single point of height.[12] These tables are therefore subject to being revised over time, and should not be amended or updated unless the entire DoBIH data is re-downloaded again. The default table ranking is by height, so where the table is sorted by for example Region, the table will list the mountains within each Region by order of height.

Demographics of the Western Balkans is article about the demographic features of the population of the Western Balkans, including average population, live births, deaths, natural change, crude rate (birth, death and natural change) per 1000 people, general, specific and total fertility rates, female fertile population (15-49 years), marriages, divorces and other aspects of the population. "Western Balkans" is a political neologism coined to refer to Albania and the territory of the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia), since the early 1990s. The region of the Western Balkans, a coinage exclusively used in Pan-European parlance, roughly corresponds to the Dinaric Alps territory.
